## Topic 1: Learning to Trust Ourselves in Difficult Situations

We see the world through our own lens - which is why knowing ourselves
is so very important. What parts of your past trigger reactions in you?
Where do you find you are at your best? What is important to you? What
bothers you? If you can articulate these things clearly then you will
have more confidence and trust yourself in difficult situations. Why is
this the case? Because when we honestly know ourselves and we join a
sense of humble awareness with a sincere desire to work with others to
make a positive impact, we have more confidence, self-efficacy and an
increased willingness to engage ‚Äì even in difficult situations. In the
Bible we read that God is working through all things for our good
(Romans 8:28). If we *really* believe this, consider how this belief
might influence your thinking, allowing you tol find peace and a humble
confidence even in difficult situations.

How does one get to know oneself? Times of solitude spent reading,
creating, walking in nature, relationships with others, new experiences,
travel are all activities that allow us to get to know ourselves,
depending on our frame of mind. If we read material that helps us ask
some of the questions mentioned above through exploring the life of
another person (fictional or real) or if we take part in experiences
that help us discover what we are good or what matters to us, these will
lead to increased self-knowledge. Flannery O‚ÄôConnor illustrates the
power of narrative saying: ‚ÄúThere is something in us, as storytellers
and as listeners to stories, that demands the redemptive act, that
demands that what falls at least be offered the change to be restored.‚Äù
(Arntz, V. 2018) Why does this matter for the adult educator? It matters
because education is about transformation of people ‚Äì not just their
intellectual growth but themselves. Transformation requires knowing
oneself first.

While Wheatley somewhat discounts the role of hope (278-280), Christian
leaders and teachers are indeed people of hope and optimism who
nonetheless realize the importance of Havel‚Äôs definition that ‚ÄúHope is
not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty
that something is worth doing no matter how it turns out‚Äù (Wheatley,
280). In other words, we need to welcome the reality of whatever
learners are bringing to the learning environment and look for the
possibilities hidden in it - the possibilities for redemption and
restoration. For example, some learners may have painful memories of
school, a sense of inadequacy or else an inflated view of themselves.
Some learners may have experienced severe trauma that affects their
ability to process information. Some learners may have trouble reading
or writing to the level we would hope they could achieve as graduate
students. Whoever our learners are and whatever abilities or
disabilities they bring, we need to create the conditions so they can
become better human beings and more knowledgeable and skillful because
of having spent time with us as their learning guides.

Our hope and vision must be rooted in the present (See [Daily Thoughts from JeanVanier)](https://sites.google.com/site/savingsoulsforgod/home/websites/l-arche/daily-thoughts-from-jean-vanier).
If that present is fraught with difficulties and challenges, the
self-aware teacher leader embraces that reality and moves forward
trusting themselves and, for the Christian, trusting God is working all
things for our good. This requires courage ‚Äì as Wheatley notes it is
rooted in ‚Äòcoeur‚Äô or heart (279). Courage with heart is needed to face
the challenges of handling challenging situations when we ourselves
might not feel equipped. Courage with heart tempered by intellectual
humility is needed to transform lives through education. Effective adult
educators are people with a vision for good, with confidence that they
can influence positive change and help facilitate transformation in
their learners because they are continually working on their own
self-knowledge and will research the strategies and methods as well as
the content that will be most helpful for their learners to be
successful.

### üìò Activity: Read and Reflect
```{block, type='reflect'}

Read Wheatley, M. (2017).¬†*Who Do We Choose to Be?: Facing Reality,
Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity.*¬†Oakland, CA: Berrett-Koehler
Publishers. Chapter 8 (pages 273-288 ) and Coda (pages 292-294).

As you read this chapter and Coda, think about your own self perceptions
and what you believe is worth doing as an adult educator.
```


### ü§îüì∫  Activity: Did You Know?
```{block, type='reflect'}
We will learn to trust ourselves more and build our confidence if we are
able to convince even ourselves of our own self-efficacy! Watch this
video (2014) ‚ÄòHow to create interest and connect with anyone‚Äô by Sam Horn.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xlg8zdSVjgg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The process described in this TedXtalk teaches the power of three ‚Äòdid you know‚Äô questions followed by three
attributes or solutions as a way to connect with others and help them
understand what‚Äôs important to you and how you can help them.

Practice this by asking yourself:

  - What is a project I care deeply about?

  - What are three questions or three statistics I can use to help
    explain the significance of this project?

Follow Sam Horn‚Äôs suggested process to create your own intriguing pitch
and try it out with others until it sounds natural and comes easily to
you.
```

## Topic 2: Approaches to Making a Contribution in an Intellectually Humble Way

The Foundation for Critical Thinking defines [intellectual humility](http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/valuable-intellectual-traits/528):

> Having a consciousness of the limits of one's knowledge, including a sensitivity to circumstances in which one's native egocentrism is likely to function self-deceptively; sensitivity to bias, prejudice and limitations of one's viewpoint. Intellectual humility depends on recognizing that one should not claim more than one actually knows. It does not imply spinelessness or submissiveness. It implies the lack of intellectual pretentiousness, boastfulness, or conceit, combined with insight into the logical foundations, or lack of such foundations, of one's beliefs.¬†

As a Christian adult educator, aim to be a servant leader-teacher. As
servant leader *teacher*, seek to engage people‚Äôs heads, hearts and
hopes and empower learners to turn their newfound knowledge and skills
into action. Infuse your role with a perspective of the common good and
engage confidently in contemporary cultural tensions. With students who
are Christian this perspective of the common good finds its roots and expression in a relationship with Jesus Christ. For students who are not
of the Christian faith, strive to espouse this in word and example in a
way that is respectful of their heritage and traditions while at the
same time giving them an understanding of the Christian worldview. Take
the time to listen for what is important to them and to understand their
beliefs in order to build bridges of understanding through respect.

Realizing that our core values, personality traits and characteristics
impact to how we learn and teach, take the time to discern your
essential values. For example, I have identified the following six
essential values to incorporate into my life and teaching: honesty,
integrity, persistence, desire to learn, compassion/empathy and
community. Because I value compassion/empathy and community, I put the
learner first and design my curricula and methodologies to suit the
learners in my class. Because I value persistence and the desire to
learn, I don‚Äôt give up on students and I try to find ways to help them
learn through different methods and alternate ways that they can
demonstrate their learning.

These values direct my entire teaching methodology; I espouse the goals of differentiated instruction (basically changing instructional methods to adapt to different learners) and aim to create a space for learning that empowers all students to succeed. (See [here](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-differentiated-instruction-examples-definition-activities.html) for more information). Differentiated instruction is a seamless part of my instructional planning and practice and I intentionally create opportunities to learn about students‚Äô strengths, needs, interests, preferences and ways of learning. [Here](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml) is an example of a self-assessment tool to help identify a learner‚Äôs learning style. To this end I use meaningful [engaging tasks](https://www.prolaera.com/7-effective-way-to-engage-adult-learners/), [flexible grouping](https://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/Teaching%20and%20Learning/TD.1.3_Bedford%26Wiebe%26Tschida_Flexible_Grouping.pdf), and ongoing [assessment and adjustment](https://lincs.ed.gov/state-resources/federal-initiatives/teal/guide/formativeassessment). I differentiate the content, process, or product components of the educational experience by using a range of strategies and methods, e.g., anchor activities, tiered lessons, small-group instruction, and varied tasks.

I‚Äôve used my own practice as a Christian educator as an example to give you some ideas and direction. Please take the time to explore the resources linked in the notes and other resources in your Brookfield and Silberman texts. The approach taken throughout this course is an intellectually humble one. In chapters five and six Brookfield (2013) particularly addresses the power dynamic in the classroom, awareness of which may foster a more intellectually humble approach. You are encouraged to use your texts as primary resources for more detailed information about specific strategies and approaches to making a contribution as an adult educator while remaining intellectually humble.
