# Course Description{-}

Learners explore theoretical foundations of learning communities, evaluate strategies for creating authentic learning communities, and apply those strategies in a learning/coaching context.   Learners explore teaching and learning through the lens of personal transformation and then widen their lens to consider systems theory and challenges of leading for an authentic learning environment. Learners explore themes such as identity, perception, interconnectedness and learning organizations. Learners will develop a personal philosophy of Learning Communities, exploring what it means to be personally authentic and how to lead authentically in a learning environment.

## Graduate Level Writing Standards{-}

For students in LDRS 664, graduate level writing standards following APA 7 are expected. Please consult the [OWL Purdue website](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html){target="_blank"} for guidance and seek assistance from the TWU Writing Center and writing coaches as needed. Assignments have rubrics that attribute some marks to APA formatting and cannot be graded as fully meeting expectations if there are APA errors. That said, your conceptual understanding remains of primary importance. It is your responsibility to ensure polished work to the highest standard of which you are capable. This demands meticulous attention to detail, which will become more 'natural' with practice. Please seek any necessary clarification from your instructor.
