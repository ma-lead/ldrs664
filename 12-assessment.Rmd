## Assignment: Company Website Analysis {-}

```{block, type='assessment'}
Investigate the Human Resources or Faculty Development portion of a company's website, a higher education institution or adult learning facility, preferably one with which you are familiar. Focus on the faculty or employee development part of the website. In this assignment, you will apply the theory of teaching in/for/with depth by analyzing the learning culture of an organization.

**In a 4-5 page APA formatted paper, analyze the website by responding to the following questions in your report:**

1. What can you infer about the company’s learning culture?  
2. From what is visible on the public website, would you say it is an authentic learning community? Why or why not? Discuss whether the website reflects aspects of one or more of the learning community models explored in previous lessons.  
3. Do you see evidence that interconnectedness and integrity are valued?  Explain.  
4. What traits and skills seem to be valued in employees?  
5. How does the company develop skills in its employees (e.g., workshops, seminars, mentoring)? Are the methods based on the principles of andragogy? (see Smith YouTube video). What specific adult learning strategies do you see reflected in the development/training opportunities for employees?  

Your paper should be 4-5 pages and should incorporate references to at least five scholarly sources you have studied in this course, or other scholarly sources you have identified.

**The paper should include:**

1. Introduction

Your paper should be written and referenced in APA format and include references to a minimum of 10 scholarly sources (this can include literature you read in this course).
You will write a draft of the Platform Paper in Unit 8 and post for Peer Review. In Unit 9, you will provide feedback to another learner on their paper. You will make revisions based on the Peer Review and, in Unit 10, you will submit the final Platform Paper. Peer reviewers will be assigned in advance.
