# LDRS 664 Communities!{-}

As this course focusses on building community with your learners, how will you build community with your colleagues?

In this course, we have the following tools available to help foster community in your course, including other students who have previously taken LDRS 664. Some of these tools will be prescribed and graded (e.g. Moodle Discussion Forums), others will be up to you to take advantage of.

Check with your course syllabus for which community tools will be used, and consider building your own Community of Practice with your classmates and external colleagues.

## Communication Tools
**Moodle Discussion Forums**: In this course, we ask you to discuss ideas with your colleagues, challenging one another and analyzing key course resources. Refer to the course syllabus for assessment details, as well as the unit Assessment section for discussion questions.  Submit your response in Moodle.

**Video Conferencing**: We will have scheduled online meetings (Zoom or Teams). Take advantage of these face-to-face conferences! Come prepared with your questions and assigned activities. Refer to the course syllabus and unit activity instructions for details.

*Optional:*
**Learning Cafe:** This discussion forum in Moodle is a place for you to interact about things going on, share resources, and generally get to know one another. Your posts don't have to be course related. Take this opportunity to connect with fellow learners and learn from one another!

*Some courses may also use the following*
**Slack:** Slack for course “management,” aka. announcements, communications, chats, small group work, etc. You can also get connected with course alumni via public Slack channels.

**Hypothesis:** We interact on top of web materials (including the textbook) during this course. Hypothesis is a cutting-edge, open-source web annotation tool, which is used more and more broadly by educators in the past two years.

**Gather:** We have a dedicated virtual classroom space to gather.

**Twitter hashtag #LDRS664:** You can tweet about this course using #LDRS664.

**WeChat:** Feel free to use a platform that works for you!!  WeChat is a popular chat forum that learners use for discussions, class projects, etc.


A key takeaway...make these forums work for you!  Interact with your peers, learn from each other, and make connections that will stay with you beyond this course.

With that, let's begin the journey together!
