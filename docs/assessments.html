<p>Throughout this course, you will be invited to write five “working” posts about what you are learning in this course. This will start with you posting to a Moodle Discussion forum, and then transition to your blog (to be introduced in Unit 3). You should consider your posts as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to share what you are learning with your community. At the end of the course you will produce a <em>Showcase Post</em>, which will represent your best work. The showcase post will be the only graded post; however, your final grade will also consider how your ideas developed over the process of you writing five working draft posts.</p>
<p>Each of your draft posts should be 400-500 words.</p>

<p>Then, post a reponse in the <em>Unit 1 Forum</em> in Moodle - defending or criticizing Anderson’s Interaction Equivalency Theorem. Ensure that you defend or criticize the idea, not the person, and include something that you have learned about interaction from somewhere other than the assigned readings.</p>
<p>If your birthday is between January 1 and June 30, <strong>defend</strong> Anderson’s Interaction Equivalency Theorem.</p>

<h2>Facilitated Curriculum Analysis (10%)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#facilitated-curriculum-analysis-10"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Working together as a learning pod, examine a curricular resource that is, or could be, used with a facilitated learning approach. Emphasis will be placed on courses in higher education, including a selection of TWU’s library of FAR courses (specifically designed to be delivered in a facilitated learning approach). However, a range of other formats are open for investigation, including (but not limited to) community-based programs, professional certification programs, corporate workshops or training programs, and masterclasses. Your pod will be invited to select a specific course of study and asked to assess the curriculum from a facilitation and coaching perspective.</p>
<p>To begin, follow the steps below:</p>
<div id="step-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Step 1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#step-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Review the course materials you have been assigned or received approve to analyze.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Step 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#step-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Write a Summary of Understanding. In this second step you will critically reflect on the course materials and write a 3-page summary of understanding from your perspective as a future learning facilitator who is preparing to facilitate this course. In your summary you will compose in your own words your thought on the following:</p>
<div id="who-is-the-course-for" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Who is the course for?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#who-is-the-course-for"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>Describe the target learners to whom the course will be offered. The instructors and/or your sponsor organization will provide you with this information. But, you should also add some of your own research.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-has-covid-19-impacted-the-learners-in-the-course" class="section level5 unnumbered">

</h5>
<p>Learners and faculty alike have been deeply impacted by coronavirus and COVID-19. How has that impacted learners in the course? Are they quarantined? Do they have access to technology at home? A quiet place to study? Are they looking after their children during the course?</p>
</div>

<h5>What challenges do you anticipate?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-challenges-do-you-anticipate"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>Identify the specific challenges that you think learners may face as they work through this particular course of study. Do parts of the course look particularly difficult? Are any resources missing, or underdeveloped, or potentially difficult for certain cultural contexts to understand?</p>
</div>
<div id="what-supports-do-you-need-to-prepare" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>What supports do you need to prepare?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-supports-do-you-need-to-prepare"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>Working as a learning pod, you will create a guide to serve as a resource for you and others to facilitate a particular course of study. We can’t emphasize enough how important it will be for you to have analyzed, critiqued, and integrated into your practice the model of coaching and facilitation in real-world settings. As you may be facilitating learning experiences in subjects where you may not have significant domain knowledge, it will be critical for you to be able to lead students through thinking and learning processes that will lead to them discovering what they need to know from the expertly prepared course materials in order to help solve their questions.</p>

<h2>Learning Labs (required but not assessed)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-labs-required-but-not-assessed"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to attend learning labs. During lab times, the instructors will be modelling learning facilitation and coaching principles and skills. The instructors will be guiding group discussions, answering any questions you may have about the course, helping you understand your assignments, and giving feedback on your participation. The learning labs are not graded; however, lab learning is connected to the graded activities below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Learning labs are scheduled for Thursdays from 11:30AM - 1:00 PM Vancouver time. <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20210903T200000&amp;p1=256&amp;p2=125&amp;p3=136">Check your local time</a>.

<h2>Learning Pods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-pods"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>At the beginning of the course everyone will be placed into small groups called learning pods. these groups, of about four people, will be the place where you will practice learning facilitation and coaching principles and skills that you are learning in this course. The pods will also form the working group for doing a curriculum analysis and developing a facilitated learning resource.</p>

</h2>
<p>Working with another student (in your pod), you will each coach each other through the process of writing your final “showcase” post as part of your learning reflection blog assignment. You will record a video of your session and write critical reflection on your actions as the learning coach.</p>
