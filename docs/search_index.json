Hikers going up a hill "],["the-heart-of-a-teacher.html", "Unit 1 The Heart of a Teacher Overview 📖 Topics 🎯 Learning Outcomes ✔️ Activity Checklist 1.1 Authenticity in Teaching and Learning 1.2 Identity and Integrity as a Coach/Facilitator 1.3 Creating Authentic Learning Spaces Unit 1 Summary ✏️ Assessment 🎯 Checking your Learning", " Unit 1 The Heart of a Teacher Image of hands making a heart by Barbara Bonanno from Pixabay Overview As humans, we long for authenticity in our relationships. We want to feel “at home” in the organizations that are part of our lives – our families, schools, communities, places of worship. We seek connection. We search for a place where we are known. This sense of being “at home” is essential to our experience as learners. Deep, authentic learning happens in spaces where we feel connected with others – places and spaces where we are known. Palmer (1998) refers to this as the “spiritual quest for connectedness” (p. 5). In this course, we will explore together the theoretical foundations of learning communities, evaluating key elements essential to creating authentic learning communities, where learners are known and learning is authentic. In this unit, we will engage with the writings of Parker Palmer, a teacher and writer who has written several important works regarding the essential role of authenticity in teaching and learning. In addition to reading, throughout this course, we will also listen to music and view several short films that will allow us to more deeply engage with the concepts of belonging and authenticity within the teaching/learning experience. 📖 Topics Unit 1 focuses on two guiding questions: What does it mean to be authentic in teaching and learning? What is the facilitator’s role in creating spaces for authentic learning? 🎯 Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit you should be able to: Describe your own personal identity as a facilitator/teacher. Identify your personal beliefs about your role as a facilitator/teacher. Discuss key elements of an authentic learning community. ✔️ Activity Checklist These learning activities will engage you in considering the guiding questions for this unit. As you plan your week, be sure to include time for these important learning activities. Note that not all activities are required. Your instructor will provide guidance on key activities to complete. Activities Activity: Read: Goode, Joanna: If you Build Teachers, will students come? Activity: Read: Palmer, P. (2017): Introduction, Chapter 1: The Heart of a Teacher: Identity and Integrity in Teaching; Chapter 3: The Hidden Wholeness: Paradox in Teaching and Learning. Activity: Reflect on your values and respond in your Reflective Learning Journal. Activity: Rank the strategies listed to create an authentic learning space that is hospitable and open. Then, read: Herrington, J. &amp; Oliver, R. (2000). An instructional design framework for authentic learning environments. Educational Technology Research and Development. 48(3), pp 23-48. Assessment: Unit 1 Discussion: Incorporating the readings in this unit, you will write a 150-250 word discussion post that addresses your values related to teaching and learning and the key elements of authentic learning spaces. See the Assessments tab for full details. 1.1 Authenticity in Teaching and Learning Teaching and learning are deeply personal experiences. Learning is, by definition, a transformative experience; we change as a result of learning. Teaching is also a transformative experience; we change as a result of teaching. Figure 1.1: Model designed by Penfold Navarro, C. (2018) In his book, The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life, Parker Palmer (2017) argues that the “inner landscape of teaching” is an essential foundation out of which authentic learning experiences emerge. Teachers possess the power to create conditions that can help students learn a great deal – or keep them from learning much at all. Teaching is the intentional act of creating those conditions, and good teaching requires that we understand the inner sources of both the intent and the act. – Palmer (2017, p. 7) 📘 Activity: Reading As we explore the importance of the “inner life of the teacher” as a foundation for authentic learning, read Chapter 1: The Heart of a Teacher: Identity and Integrity in Teaching in The Courage to Teach (Palmer, 2017). For this course, you will keep a Reflective Learning Journal, which will provide the basis for many of your blog posts. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, organize, and integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, as you prepare for your future teaching/coaching. 💭 Consider the following questions: • In your Reflective Learning Journal, write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a teacher/facilitator/coach. • Choose the concept that most resonates with you and write a short paragraph summary of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context. • Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions. • As you prepare your discussions, refer to these notes. 1.2 Identity and Integrity as a Coach/Facilitator Identity and integrity are foundational to good teaching. This means we must endeavour to know ourselves and to create learning spaces that foster integrity in our students, allowing them to authentically engage with each other, with us, and with the discipline we are studying. In order to have integrity, we must know our own values and strengths, our own beliefs about teaching and learning, and our own perspective on the work we are doing. If the work we do lacks integrity for us, then we, the work, and the people we do it with will suffer. – Palmer (2017, p. 16) ✏️ Activity: Reflect and Respond As teachers, it’s important to identify and reflect on your own values. Consider why you are taking this course. Why do you want to coach/facilitate learning? What are your beliefs about learning? What are your values about learning? What are your strengths? Where do you need help? Take some time to answer the questions above in your Reflective Learning journal. 1.3 Creating Authentic Learning Spaces For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known. – 1 Corinthians 13:12 (ESV) As we begin thinking about creating authentic learning spaces, consider a time when you have felt “at home” within a learning community, whether in formal education, your faith community, or your employment. What elements made that learning space feel like “home?” In the song, *Home**, Phillip Phillips sings about the universal need we share as humans to “belong.” Take a moment now to listen to this song, considering what the lyrics say about what it means to belong. LINK Just know you’re not alone ’Cause I’m going to make this place your home. – Phillip Phillips, In order for students to authentically learn, we must create learning spaces that are safe, where students know and feel that they belong. Palmer (1998) refers to this need for belonging as the “spiritual quest for connectedness” (p.5). If a sense of belonging provides a foundation for learning, then in our role as teachers, facilitators, or coaches, we must endeavour to create spaces where students know and feel that they belong. Good teachers possess a capacity for connectedness. They are able to eave a complex web of connections among themselves, their subjects, and their students so that students can learn to weave a world for themselves. – Palmer (2017, p. 11) But how is this done? In “To Know As We Are Known,” Palmer (1993) suggests that learning spaces must include openness, boundaries, and an air of hospitality. These learning spaces, according to Palmer (1993) can be spaces “both to be and to become” (p. 71). ✏️ Activity: Ranking Rank the following strategies according to your comfort level. For each strategy, list one practical action you can take in an online learning environment (as facilitator or learner) to create an authentic learning space that is hospitable and open.* “To study with a teacher who not only speaks but listens, who not only gives answers but asks questions and welcomes our insights, who provides information and theories that do not close doors but open new ones, who encourages students to help each other learn – to study with such a teacher is to know the power of a learning space” (Palmer, 1997, pp. 70-71) Speaking Listening Giving answers Asking questions Providing information/theories that open doors Encouraging students to help each other learn Next, read the discussion of authentic learning environments in Herrington and Oliver (2000), consider how the elements they discuss align with or differ from Palmer’s (2017) description of learning communities. 📘 Herrington, J. and Oliver, R. (2000). An instructional design framework for authentic learning environments. 💭 Questions to Consider After completing the activities above, consider the following questions: What are the important values that will guide my teaching/facilitation? What elements matter most to me in a learning community? What can I do to create hospitable learning spaces? Unit 1 Summary In this first unit, you have had the opportunity to think and learn about your identify and beliefs about your role as a facilitator/teacher, and consider key elements of authentic learning communities. The hunger for authentic human relationships and authentic learning can and should compel us to consider our own identity and integrity, both as teachers and learners. In our next unit, we will explore ideas related to vulnerability in leadership, and learning to be “at home” with ourselves so we can, in turn, lead and teach others. ✏️ Assessment Unit 1 Discussion After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a discussion post on the following: Part 1 Incorporating the readings in this unit, write a 150-250 word discussion post that addresses the following: List and describe three values you hold related to teaching and learning. Write a personal statement about your identity as a coach/facilitator. Part 2 For the second part of your discussion, write a 150-250 response to the following: Consider the key elements of authentic learning spaces, outlined by Palmer (2017) in Chapter 3. Select two of these elements that you consider to be important. Introduce the element and discuss some practical steps you could take to create an authentic learning space. Respond to at least two other learners, providing additional suggestions regarding the elements they have chosen. Be sure to cite Palmer (2017) and other authors in both your initial posting and your responses to other learner to demonstrate ways in which your thinking aligns with, contrasts with, or builds on the writing of the authors. Your instructor will provide direction about how to complete this activity. Grading Criteria See the following rubric that explains how your discussion contributions will be evaluated. 🎯 Checking your Learning Before you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to: - Describe your own personal identity as a facilitator/teacher. - Identify your personal beliefs about your role as a facilitator/teacher. - Discuss key elements of an authentic learning community.

Activity: Participate in the exercise, “Nine Why’s” Assessment: Unit 2 Discussion: Write a discussion post on belonging and the “Nine Why’s” activity. See the Assessments section for more details. 2.1 Belonging to Myself In order to create authentic, safe learning spaces for others, we must first be comfortable with who we are. Identity: Knowing ourselves as teachers means that we must explore what Palmer (2017) calls the “inner landscape.” We must be aware of the character traits, personal experiences, values, beliefs, and cultural environment in which we were raised and now live. These elements are part of our identity – and we bring our identity with us into the classroom and learning spaces in which we coach and teach others (Palmer, 2017). Integrity: So, too, our integrity comes with us into the learning spaces in which we teach. Integrity, from Palmer’s (2017) discussion, is not about ethics, but about an integrated sense of self – a self that is whole, integrating life experiences and values and beliefs in a meaningful, authentic way. Whether we are aware of it or not, our integrity and identity are part of who we are as teachers. It is on this foundation that we build connections with students, and are able to invite them into spaces where personal transformation and authentic learning will take place. Authenticity is also an essential ingredient for effective leadership. Authentic leadership includes elements of both self-knowledge and identity, as well as collaboration with others within the context of relationship (Northhouse, 2019). Avolio, Walumbwa and Weber (2009) provide a model of authentic leadership that includes “self-awareness, internalized moral perspective, balanced processing, and relational transparency” (as cited in Northhouse, 2019, p. 198). However, even when we long to be vulnerable and authentic within our roles as teachers or leaders, we are often challenged by our own desire to project competence and strength, thinking that vulnerability and strength are mutually exclusive. Despite our need for authentic leaders and teachers, many of us remain reluctant to share any level of vulnerability – perhaps even more so when we are in positions of influence, as teachers, coaches, or leaders. In her book, Imposter Phenomenon: When Success Makes You Feel Like a Fake, Clance (1985) argues that many of us enter the arena of public engagement and career with concerns about whether we really belong. This fear often means we are afraid that being vulnerable or authentic will reveal to others that we do not truly “belong” in our roles. The first step to belonging, as seen in the work of Brown (2017) and Palmer (2017) is a sense of our own identity – including both our strengths and our areas of disconnection or discontent. Both these scholars urge us to understand our own humanity – to “learn to trust ourselves and trust others” (Brown, 2017, p. 37). As poet Maya Angelou discusses, belonging to one’s self is an ongoing journey – a journey that is not always easy. I belong to myself. – Maya Angelou, 1973 2.1.1 💭 Activity: Who are you? For this activity, you are asked to share a little more about yourself with your peers. First, find a quote about either identity or integrity. For example, you may want to perform a Google image search for “identity quote.” Find one that resonates with you, and then include a picture of something that tells us something about you. Post the quote and your image to the Unit 2 Discussion forum with a 1-2 sentence explanation. This is a non-graded activity, but may help you reflect on this topic and to prepare for the assignment in this unit. 2.1.2 📘 Activity: View and Reflect View the following resources and reflect on your learning: - Read. Brown, B. (2017). Chapter 1: Everywhere and Nowhere. - Watch: Maya Angelou: Interview with Bill Moyers (7 minutes). 2.2 Vulnerability in Learning Communities Learning to be vulnerable enough to share our authentic selves can be challenging – and knowing how much to be vulnerable (and when!) also poses a challenge, both in teaching and leadership. Students also wrestle with similar questions – How much of myself should I share in this class? This paper? This blog? Is this a safe space to express my own feelings of vulnerability? Authenticity is built on trust – spaces in which you are comfortable enough to share your true self – your identity. Brown (2017) argues that “self-trust” provides a foundation for belonging. Authenticity involves both owning one’s personal experiences (values, thoughts, emotions and beliefs) and acting in accordance with one’s true self (expressing what you really think and believe and behaving accordingly) (Harter, 2002, as cited in Gardner, Avolio, Luthans, May, and Walumbwa, 2005, pp. 344-5). Gardner et al. (2005) describe authentic leadership is demonstrated when “relationships are characterized by: a) transparency, openness, and trust, b) guidance toward worthy objectives, and c) an emphasis on follower development” (p. 345). If effective relationships include these characteristics, then authentic teachers and leaders must consider what it means to be transparent and open, as well as what it means to extend trust. 2.2.1 📺 Activity: Vulnerability Video Watch the TedTalk by Brene Brown: (20 minutes) plugin:youtube  💭 As you watch, consider the following questions: What elements of a learning community would create conditions for learners to be vulnerable about their fears about the course, their concerns about learning, and their questions regarding whether they are capable of achieving success in their course? In what ways do you feel vulnerable as a teacher/facilitator? Are there people with whom you can share this vulnerability? You may want to answer these questions in your Reflective Learning Journal, and refer back to them as you complete the assessment for this unit. 2.2.2 📘 Activity: Brown Reading &amp; Reflection Brown (2017) argues that authenticity is essential to belonging. You will always belong anywhere you show up as yourself and talk about yourself and your work in a real way. – Brene Brown (2017, p. 26) As you read Brown (2017) Chapter 2, answer the following questions in your Reflective Learning Journal: Write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to belonging. Choose the concept that you would like to apply in your own learning communities, both as a student and teacher/facilitator. Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions. As you prepare your discussion post, refer to these notes. 2.2.3 ✏️ Activity: Sharing your Identity Being vulnerable involves sharing something of our true selves, which we might not always be comfortable doing in certain environments. In your Reflective Learning Journal, consider a time when you were your “true self” in a professional or personal setting in which you wondered if you really “belonged.” Perhaps this is a time when shared your spoke up about an issue that was important to you, lead a team in a new direction, or created a process that felt more authentic to you. What part of yourself did you share? How did this make you feel vulnerable? What were the results? 2.3 Creating Connections with Learners In our role as teachers, we are asked to connect students with new ways of thinking and knowing, as well as new knowledge. But the first (and perhaps most important) connections we make (and the connections on which all learning is built) are connections between students, and between students and teachers. Good teachers join self and subject and students in the fabric of life. – Parker Palmer (1998, p. 11) Leadership, like teaching, relies not just on the relationships that teachers form with learners, but also on the identity of the teacher. “Authentic leaders understand their own values and behave toward others based on these values” (Northouse, 2019, p. 201). These relationships will form the basis for learning in the classroom. Learning is, at its heart, a personal activity. Learners often experience vulnerability as they enter into (and continue through) the learning experience, wondering if they belong, if they are up to the challenge, and if they will succeed. 2.3.1 👂 Activity: Listen and Reflect Listen to “Brave” sung by Sara Bareilles. plugin:youtube 💭 As you listen to this song, consider the following questions: Is there an area in my current professional work where I need to be brave and speak up? What fears would keep me from sharing my thoughts or experience? How will I create a learning community that allows learners to share their thoughts authentically? 2.3.2 ✏️ Activity: Self-Test (non-graded) Take the Clance Imposter Phenomenon test. As you take the test, consider the areas in which you feel vulnerable in your work as a learner. How would you address these concerns for learners in courses you facilitate? 2.3.3 📘 Activity: Readings Read: Gardner, B., Avolio, B., Luthans, F., May, D. &amp; Walumbwa, F. (2005) Can you see the real me? A self-based model of authentic leader and follower development. The Leadership Quarterly 16, pp. 343–372. Optional Read: Cuddy, A. (2016). I don’t deserve to be here: Presence and the imposter syndrome. 2.3.4 🗬 🗭 Activity: Connection Activities &amp; Discussion “Liberating Structures” (Lipmanowicz &amp; McCandless, 2013) are used in collaborative learning and work environments to create space for all participants to engage in collaborative inquiry and unleash innovation. One of these “Liberating Structures” is the strategy of the “Nine Whys,” which allows participants to clarify what is important in their work. You may choose to use a strategy like this in your role as a facilitator and teacher. For this learning activity, however, you will use the strategy of the “Nine Whys” to consider your own identity as a teacher/facilitator. Identify someone in your life who knows you well, with whom you have a history of talking about your goals or dreams. Ask them to participate in this exercise with you. Begin by telling them why you are taking this course, as well as why you want to engage in teaching/coaching/facilitation. When you have finished talking, your “Nine Whys” partner will ask you: Why is that important to you? Your partner should continue asking that question up to nine times, or until you cannot go any deeper. At this point, you will have uncovered something fundamental about your identity as a teacher/facilitator. As you complete this exercise, take detailed notes in your Reflective Learning Journal. You will be asked to create a discussion post about this experience in the Unit 2 Assessment. Unit 2 Summary In this unit, we have explored the importance of identity, authenticity, and vulnerability in creating authentic learning communities. Our own identity as a teacher will go with us into the classroom, and we will be able to build on our own abilities to create connections as we share our authentic selves with students. In the next unit, we will focus on strategies to create a sense of belonging among students, building on our own understanding of vulnerability to create spaces where students, too, can bring their authentic selves to the learning experience. ✏️ Assessment Unit 2 Discussion Part 1: Belonging After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a discussion post on the following: Referring to Brown (2017) Chapter 2, answer the following questions: Write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to belonging. Choose the concept that you would like to apply in your own learning communities, both as a student and teacher/facilitator.

She contrasts a true sense of “belonging” to “fitting in” which she describes as a sense of being accepted, but not as one’s true self. We want to be part of something, but we need it to be real – not conditional or fake or constantly up for negotiation. We need true belonging. – Brene Brown (2017, p. 31) According to Brown (2017), belonging involves a certain level of vulnerability, because it means we are must show up as our true selves – and those selves often include some level of doubt or weakness or insecurity. She defines “belonging” this way: Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance – (Brown, 2017, p. 32). Part of our role as teachers and facilitates or to foster learning communities where students can truly belong. 3.2 Topic 2: Creating Learning Spaces Where Students Belong Learning, by its nature, requires us to wrestle with ideas and facts and theoretical perspectives that are new or contradict our current knowledge or beliefs. Therefore, learning spaces must serve as spaces where we can be challenged by new ideas and challenge our current thinking, while at the same time feel confident that our thoughts and perspective are valued. These learning spaces must simultaneously allow us to be our authentic selves – and allow others to be authentic as well. Brene Brown (2017) discusses key concepts of creating spaces that facilitate a sense of belonging – including civility, inclusive language, truth, and respect. Often, the balance between truth and civility can be challenging – as we seek to authentically discuss new ideas – but in a manner that is both civil and respectful of others. Trust is at the heart of authentic learning communities. Brown (2017) uses the acronym “BRAVING” to describe key elements of trust. These elements include Boundaries, Reliability, Accountability, Vault, Integrity, Non-Judgement, and Generosity (p. 114). Palmer (2017) also argues that spaces free of fear are necessary for authentic learning. He describes a “shutdown” that occurs as we seek to protect ourselves – both teachers and students – and as we think about learning and knowing in from an either-or perspective, failing to acknowledge the great vastness of truth. Learning communities, then, must be places of trust, with a focus on learning that incorporates both “profound truth” and “paradox” (Palmer, 2017, p. 65). Brower and Dettinger (1998) contend that diversity of thought and perspective is an essential element of a learning community. “When we define a community as a group of individuals committed to shared values and goals, who purposefully come together and work together to reach these goals, then diversity is encouraged not just for ideological reasons but also because different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds contribute to the collaborative efforts to achieve the community’s goals” (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998, p. 16). 3.2.1 Activity 3.1: Read and Reflect Read: Brown (2017). Chapters 3-4. Then, find a quiet space in your home or outdoors. Make your favourite beverage. With your iced coffee or hot tea with honey next to you, settle into a comfortable position. Read the poem by Rainer Maria Rilke “Ah, not to be cut off”. Sit for a moment with this poem. Re-read it. Consider the words and ideas expressed by Rilke. In your Reflective Journal, jot down your thoughts. Consider how you have, in your own learning experiences, experienced “the winds of homecoming” or the desire “not to be cut off.” Image by Engin Akyurt from Pixabay 3.2.2 Activity 3.2: Read and Reflect Read Palmer (2017) Chapter 2. As you read, consider these questions: How am I “at home in a universe that embraces both the smallness of ‘I’ and the vastness of all that is ‘not I,’?” (Palmer, 2017, p. 59). What fears do I need to overcome as a teacher so I can create space for students to express their fears? Activity 3.3: Listen and Reflect Listen to A Place in this World, sung by Taylor Swift. plugin:youtube Consider the following scenario: Imagine a student in a course you are facilitating. A young student submits a poorly written assignment and then does not complete the next week’s assignment. When you ask the student to meet with you, she shares this song with you and shares that she feels all alone, she doesn’t feel confident writing at an academic level, and she didn’t do this week’s assignment because she’s afraid she will fail. She thinks she probably shouldn’t have been admitted to this program. In your Reflective Journal, compose an email or talking points for a conversation with the student, specifically describing why she belongs in this course. Unit 3 Summary In this unit, you have had the opportunity to consider concepts related to our own sense of “belonging to others” and what it means to create safe learning spaces, built on trust and an awareness that learning is both vast and paradoxical. Bringing our selves to the educational experience – both as teachers/facilitators and as students/learners, we must seek to authentically engage in the learning experience – and to form connections with other learners. In the next unit, we will move from the philosophical and self-reflective to explore practical strategies for creating authentic learning communities. ✏️ Assessment Unit 3 Discussion Part A: BRAVING Using the BRAVING checklist (Brown, 2017, p. 114), write a 250-word discussion post that includes a description of each element of the checklist, as well as a 2-3 sentence description of how you would apply this concept in a course to create an inclusive, authentic learning community. Part B: Belonging Learning Activity Based on the learning activities in this unit, create a learning activity you would use in a course that incorporates elements of belonging, discussed in the course readings and your blog posts. Include the learning outcome for the activity, the learning activity, and a discussion of how the different elements of the learning activity would serve to support a sense of belonging for students. Grading Criteria See the following rubric that explains how your discussion contributions will be evaluated. Assignment 1: Identity as a Teacher Paper (20%) Building on your learning in the first three weeks of class, write a 3-4 page paper in which you describe your identity as a teacher/facilitator. Incorporate references to the Brown (2017) and Palmer (2017) texts, as well as other resources from your graduate coursework. The paper should include an introduction, a statement of your identity as a teacher/facilitator, and a discussion of three important aspects of that identity. Your conclusion should include a discussion of how you will use your identity to create authentic spaces for learning in the courses you facilitate/teach. Grading Criteria See the following rubric that explains how your assignment will be evaluated. 🎯 Checking your Learning Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit.

A learning community can be created within a specific course, academic program, or professional context. Learning communities can be found across university campuses and often include a set of interdisciplinary, paired-courses that students take as a cohort. They can be grounded in residence halls with an integration of living and learning. Or, they can be developed in formal educational environments with a focus on students learning together as a cohort. Professional learning communities have also emerged as an important force in education and other fields, as colleagues gather around a shared interest, a focus on continuous quality improvement, and a shared discipline. Learning communities are authentic, emotionally-safe and inclusive spaces (whether physical or virtual) where learners and teachers come together to engage in deep learning. By definition, a learning community includes both LEARNING and COMMUNITY. Unit 4 focuses on 2 guiding questions: What is a learning community? What key elements are essential to learning communities? 📖 Topics In this unit, our topics explore three different models of learning communities. Pyramid Model of Learning Communities (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998) The Community of Truth (Palmer, 2017) Trinity Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017) 🎯 Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit you should be able to: Describe elements of an authentic learning community.

As you plan your week, be sure to include time for these important learning activities. Note that not all activities are required. Your instructor will provide guidance on key activities to complete. | Activities Activity 4.1: Read “What IS a Learning Community?” (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998) and respond in your Reflective Journal. Activity 4.2: Read: Palmer, P. (2017) The Courage to Teach,  Chapter 4 Knowing in Community and respond in your Reflective Journal. Activity 4.3: Trinity Model of Collaborative Inquiry and respond in your Reflective Journal. Activity 4.4: Complete your Discussion post and respond to two other peers. 4.1 Learning Community Pyramid The Learning Community Pyramid, developed by Brower &amp; Dettinger (1998) includes academic, social, and physical components. They describe academic components as those that focus on the curriculum and learning that takes place. The social components are the elements of trust and inclusivity that create space for community. The physical component is the “place or facility where the community meets or resides” (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998, p. 17). In the case of this course, that “place” is the course hub. Building on the foundation of social, physical, and academic elements, Brower and Dettinger (1998) contend that learning communities also include three areas of responsibility: ethical responsibility, civic responsibility, and professional responsibility (p. 17). According to Brower &amp; Dettinger (1998), “Learning communities, to be considered as such, must integrate academic subject matter and social interactions while providing the physical space or facility for an intellectually stimulating environment to emerge. Furthermore, learning communities must be designed to develop a triad of responsibilities within students—professional, ethical, and civic” (p. 16). As you consider the learning community you will facilitate, consider how you might develop or model professional, ethical, and civic responsibility within that community. Do you think leaders should develop these same areas of responsibility with the organizations or companies they lead? 4.1.1 Learning Activity 4.1 Read “What IS a Learning Community?” (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998). In your Reflective Journal, write down three strengths of this learning community model. Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community. Do you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create? Why or Why not? As we compare the other two models, feel free to organize your thoughts into a chart such as the following: Strengths of model Aspects Unique to this Model Questions Learning Community Pyramid (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998) Community of Truth model (Palmer, 2017) Trinity Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017) 4.2 The Community of Truth (Palmer, 2017) Palmer’s learning community model (2017) incorporates both learning and community with a “subject” as the center, surrounded by “knowers” who are in relationship to both each other and the subject. Palmer (2017) assets that “the community of truth, far from being linear and static and hierarchical, is circular, interactive, and dynamic” (p. 106). Figure 4.1: Palmer’s Community of Truth model. From https://uncc.instructure.com/courses/342/pages/module-3-why-discussions The learning that takes place in this model is captured in this statement: “I understand truth as the passionate and disciplined process of inquiry and dialogue itself, as the dynamic conversation of a community that keeps testing old conclusions and coming into new ones” (p. 106). As teachers, we approach teaching with some sense that we have some thing (some subject) to teach students. Palmer (2017) challenges us to think differently about the teaching/learning experience. (See “The Objectivist Myth of Knowing,” p. 103 and “The Community of Truth,” p. 105). Instead of solely focusing on what we must teach (and what students must learn), Palmer challenges us to consider how we all might learn something more together – more than is already known – through the teaching/learning experience. In this way, we must consider that we are not just engaged in transferring information or knowledge, but that (in addition to that), together we might create new knowledge. ! “I know of no field, from science to religion, where what we regard as objective knowledge did not emerge from long and complex communal discourse that continues to this day, no field where the facts of the matter were delivered fully formed from on high” (Palmer, 2017, p. 107). Palmer’s (2017) model highlights the relational knowledge of learning communities, underscoring not just the relationship of the people involved, but also the relationships between people and subject. As you consider facilitating learning communities, give some thought to your own relationship to the subject to be taught and learned. Consider whether you “know” this subject objectively or subjectively. 4.2.1 Learning Activity 4.2: Read The Courage to Teach, Chapter 4 “Knowing in Community” (Palmer, 2017). In your Reflective Journal, write down three strengths of this learning community model. Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community. Do you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create? Why or Why not? 4.3 The TWU Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017) In our online courses, Trinity Western University seeks to create learning communities that engage student learning on a cognitive, social, and spiritual level. The TWU Community of Inquiry model is a visual representation of these three aspects of learning (Social, Cognitive, and Spiritual), and how they interact with each other. At the intersections of these elements, you find: Community of Inquiry Community of Faith Integration of Faith and Reason Combined, these three elements can lead to transformational learning – an aspiration we hold in this course and program – and a fundamental goal of higher education in a broader sense.

Why or Why not? 4.3.2 Activity 4.4: Discussion Post After completing Learning Activities 4.1-3, write a 250-word discussion post. Provide a brief description of each of the three models (with citations as appropriate). Select the learning community model that most closely aligns with your identity and values as a teacher/facilitator. In your post, tell your readers the strengths you see in this model, explaining why it resonates with your concepts of teaching and learning. Unit 4 Summary The learning community models we have considered in this unit share some similarities. In each model, there is an awareness that learners and learning is multidimensional. As we engage in teaching and learning, we must always be aware that the learning process is, fundamentally, transformative. It engages people, not only on an intellectual level, but also on a spiritual and social level. By designing curriculum, pedagogy, and learning around all aspects of learning – social, cognitive, and spiritual – we provide the foundation for transformational learning. Palmer (2017) puts it this way: “The reality we belong to, the reality we long to know, extends far beyond human beings interacting with one another… This is a community held together not only by our personal powers of thought and feeling but also by the power of ‘the grace of great things’” (p. 109). As Palmer (2017) points out, learning includes both thought (cognitive) and feeling (social), but also something beyond those – the overarching spiritual nature of life and learning. ✏️ Assessment Unit 4 Discussion After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a 250-word discussion post on the following: Provide a brief description of each of the three models (with citations as appropriate).

Activity 5.4: Read Burwell &amp; Huyser (2013). Practicing hospitality in the classroom. Respond in your Reflective Learning Journal. Activity 5.6: Student Interview and Unit 5 Discussion 5.1 Creating Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment In our role as a teacher or facilitator, we are engaged in leading learners through a transformational educational process. “Collaborative Inquiry” is a process through which we, as educators, engage in learning about the practice of teaching through collaborative inquiry and reflection (Donohoo &amp; Velasco, 2016). Athabasca University defines a Community of Inquiry as “a group of individuals who collaboratively engage in purposeful critical discourse and reflection to construct personal meaning and confirm mutual understanding” (Athabasca University, n.d.). While Collaborative Inquiry is often used to describe a process used by professional learning communities to guide organizational change – or to describe Communities of Practice among educators – collaborative inquiry is also a practice that can be implemented within classrooms. The fields of Collaborative Inquiry (Donohoo &amp; Velasco, 2016) and Appreciative Inquiry (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010) are built on the premise that we must all collaborate together in a community of learners, and that by doing so, we can generate learning that goes beyond what we might learn on our own. It is a strengths-based approach to learning and change that has been described as “unifying moments when joy touches joy, strength touches strength, health touches health, inspiration combines with inspiration – and how to make the combinations happen more rapidly and frequently” (Cooperrider, D., as cited in Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xiii). Palmer’s (2017) “Community of Truth” that we explored in the last unit, incorporates the essence of collaborative learning, underscoring the importance of relationship within education. He writes, “What seems right for me, after many years of searching, is to sit in a circle with my students (or try to relate to the crowd in a lecture hall as if we were in a circle) and lead an inquiry into the great thing in our midst, But there are other ways to create community in the classroom, and some of them look nothing like the interactive encounter we normally associate with that word” (p. 139). Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom cast a compelling vision for collaborative environments where the act of engaging in appreciative inquiry can transform communities. They write: “Appreciative Inquiry transforms organizations into places that are free and alive, where people are eager and filled with positive power, and where the creativity of the whole never ceases to amaze, surprise, and innovate” (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xi). Learning communities, too, can become places that are free and alive, where all members of the community engage in challenging, authentic learning. Appreciative Inquiry (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010) is built on eight principles, which can inform the way we support learners in an online learning context. These include: The Constructionist Principle The Simultaneity Principle The Poetic Principle The Anticipatory Principle The Positive Principle The Wholeness Principle The Enactment Principle The Free-Choice Principle (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52). These principles can serve as a guide for facilitating online discussions, designing lessons, and providing formative feedback to learners. For example, the “Simultaneity Principle” is based on the premise that by its nature, asking questions not only leads to change, but the very act of engaging in inquiry is, in fact, the first step in change. According to this principle, “the moment we ask a question, we begin to create a change” (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52). Likewise, the “Free-Choice Principle” contends that “people perform better and are more committed when they have freedom to choose how and what they contribute” (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52). Facilitating discussions that allow learners to engage in conversation (whether face-to-face or online), determine some aspects of their assignments, select topics, etc., can have a powerful influence on student engagement with learning. 5.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect Read: Palmer, P. (2017) The Courage to Teach, Chapter 5 Teaching in Community; Chapter 6 Learning in Community, Chapter 7 Divided No More. In your Reflective Journal, make notes on the following questions: What specific actions could you take to invite students in to the “community of truth?” What questions can I ask to invite students to engage in collaborative, inquiry-based learning? 5.1.2 Activity: Read and Discuss Review the “Principles of Appreciative Inquiry” from the Appreciative Inquiry Commons at Champlain University, or in Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom. (2010). The power of appreciative inquiry: A practical guide to positive change. Select two of the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry. In a 250-word blog post, describe a learning activity you would conduct with your class that integrates both of these principles. For example, how would you design a writing assignment that included “Positive Principle?” Or, describe an assignment through which you ask students to create a short video that incorporates the “Poetic Principle.” 5.2 Supporting Connections Between Learners Creating a positive, open, learning environment is a critical component for fostering authentic learning – a place where we can both belong to ourselves and to others. Brown (2017) poses these questions: Are we willing to show up and be seen when we can’t control the outcome? Are we willing to create courageous spaces so we can be fully seen? (p. 154) Palmer (2017), offers five suggestions for ways in which we can prepare students for engagement in authentic communities – both in education, our places of work, and our communities. We must help our students debunk the myth that institutions process autonomous, even ultimate, power over our lives. We must validate the importance of our students’ emotions as well as their intellect. We must teach our students how to “mine” their emotions for knowledge. We must teach them how to cultivate community or the sake of both knowing and doing. We must teach – and model for – our students what is meant to be on the journey toward “an undivided life.” (p. 205). In this course, we are exploring concepts of education that include our emotional experiences with learning, the importance of community, the nature of knowledge, and the foundational importance of the teacher’s authenticity. For some academics, the acknowledgement of the emotional experience of education can be challenging, according to Palmer, who argues that the feelings we have influence our learning. Donohoo and Velasco (2016), in their work on Collaborative Inquiry, also underscore the importance of acknowledging the emotional experiences of student. “There is no doubt that learning is interrupted when negative emotions and attitudes surface, as such feelings hinder our ability to make sense of things” (Donohoo and Velasco, 2016, p. 36). 5.2.1 Activity: Reflect For this activity, you will spend some time reflecting on your own experience as a learner, in order to consider the needs of the students you lead in online and face-to-face learning environments. So pick up your Reflective Learning Journal, grab your laptop, and settle down into a comfy chair (or sit among some trees). Watch the short film Identity by Kalhil KJ Adames (5 minutes). Listen to the song “Brave” sung by Sarah Barreilles. Read Brown (2017) Braving the Wilderness, Chapter 7 Strong Back. Soft Front. Wild Heart. Jot down some of your notes describing your own identity as a student. List 2-3 times in your educational experience where you have been “brave” by sharing your thoughts or concerns in a learning environment – whether with other learners or teachers. List 2-3 times when you wanted to speak up, but chose instead to remain silent. Reflect on how these actions impacted your experience as a learner. Consider what you might do, as a course facilitator, to encourage learners to speak up. 5.2.2 Activity: Read and Strategize Read Burwell &amp; Huyser (2013). Practicing hospitality in the classroom (available through the TWU Library). In your Reflective Learning Journal, make a note of the “stances” described by the authors. For each Stance, list one strategy you can employ to practice hospitality in your classes. Be as specific as possible. 5.2.3 Activity: Interview In this activity and discussion, you will interview another student in this class to explore strategies for creating inclusive, collaborative learning communities. First, develop a minimum of five questions to guide the interview process. The questions should be developed based on your course learning to date, and should integrate the articles, Ted talks, short films, and other resources we have reviewed together. Building on your learning, develop at least five questions that you will ask another learner, in order to answer the guiding questions of this unit: What strategies invite students to engage in collaborative learning? What strategies can we use in online learning environments to support connections between students? Then, contact the student assigned to you for this assignment and schedule a time to meet, preferably in real-time, through zoom, skype, some other form of video conferencing, or by phone. After you have completed the interview, reflect on your classmate’s responses and your own reading. Synthesizing your learning, prepare a 250-word discussion post, identifying at least three strategies you can use to help learners develop questions with each other. Be sure to reference the other learner for her/his original ideas. Unit 5 Summary In this unit, we have considered how we can create learning environments where students belong, the essential nature of creating connections between learnings, and specific strategies we can use to support collaborative learning. ✏️ Assessment Unit 5 Discussion After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a discussion post on the following: Part 1: Principles of Appreciative Inquiry Select two of the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry. In a 250-word post, describe a learning activity you would conduct with your class that integrates both of these principles. For example, how would you design a writing assignment that included “Positive Principle?” Or, describe an assignment through which you ask students to create a short video that incorporates the “Poetic Principle.” Part 2: Peer Interview First, develop a minimum of five questions to guide the interview process. The questions should be developed based on your course learning to date, and should integrate the articles, Ted talks, short films, and other resources we have reviewed together. Building on your learning, develop at least five questions that you will ask another learner, in order to answer the guiding questions of this unit: What strategies invite students to engage in collaborative learning? What strategies can we use in online learning environments to support connections between students? Then, contact the student assigned to you for this assignment and schedule a time to meet, preferably in real-time, through zoom, skype, some other form of video conferencing, or by phone. After you have completed the interview, prepare a 250-word blog post, identifying at least three strategies you can use to engage students in collaborative learning as well as strategies you can use to support connections between students in online learning environments. Be sure to reference the other learner for her/his original ideas. 🎯 Checking your Learning Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit. Can you: Identify facilitator strategies that invite students to engage in collaborative learning? Identify strategies in online learning environments that support connections between students?

In units 5-10 we will broaden the lens to consider the adult educator as authentic leader and facilitator in the learning environment. We will engage with the writings of Margaret Wheatley, a peace activist, philosopher, world traveler and management consultant. Before you begin the second half of the course, I invite you to take a few minutes to explore her website and get a sense of her work as it relates to creating authentic learning communities. Her book contains powerful concepts that will challenge you to see leadership with a new lens. She suggests that her book not be read but savoured because the concepts need to be dwelt upon. I agree that you will get more out the book if you take your time, pause frequently and note ideas in your reflective journal. In this unit we will consider the impact of identity in a learning environment and the adult educator as creator and leader of a learner centered environment. Given the prominence of technology in contemporary society, we will consider Wheatley’s comments about the use of technology and how this influences leadership and communication. 📖 Topics The Impact of Identity in a Learning Environment The Adult Educator as Creator and Leader of a Learner Centered Learning Environment 🎯 Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit you should be able to: Evaluate personal and professional attitudes towards technology in light of authentic learning and identity. Develop a personal philosophy of the role of facilitator in creating authentic learning communities Evaluate and choose strategies to adapt to the identity and learning needs of participants. ✔️ Activity Checklist These learning activities will engage you in considering the guiding questions for this unit. As you plan your week, be sure to include time for these important learning activities. Note that not all activities are required. Your instructor will provide guidance on key activities to complete. Activities Activity 6.1: Read Wheatley: Opening and chapters 1 and 2. Activity 6.2: Take notes in your Reflective Journal on chapters 1 and 2. Activity 6.3: Take notes in your journal about the impact of technology. Activity 6.4: Choose one of the two topics listed and write your discussion post 6.1 The Impact of Identity in a Learning Environment An essential question for adult educators to reflect on is: What matters to me and how can my work advance this in some way? Discovering and acting upon a purpose beyond oneself brings meaning to work and can motivate learners to find meaning also. This leads to a deeper commitment and sense of fulfillment. Having a greater purpose creates unity and fights fragmentation in the activities of life. The words of Jean Vanier are a call to action for all adult educators: It is always good for individuals, communities and indeed nations, to remember that their present situation is a result of the thousands of gestures of love or hate that came before. This obliges us to remember that the community of tomorrow is being born of our fidelity to the present. We discover that we are at the same time very insignificant and very important because each of our actions is preparing the humanity of tomorrow; it is a tiny contribution to the huge and glorious final humanity. (Vanier, 1989, p.152) What we value, we prioritize, and this directs our work and lives, shaping not just what we do but who we become. We need to start practicing now who we want to be in the future (Bregman, P., 2016). Adult educators have a privileged position in the lives of their students that can be leveraged to help them develop the skills, attitudes and dispositions they need to improve their lives and those of others. In this sense, an adult educator is a leader of self and a leader in the classroom. Who we are matters. Figuring out how our identity impacts the learning environment involves discerning our personal values through self-reflection. What makes us act and react the way we do? Through what screens do we view and respond to life? On what basis do we make decisions? Questions, like those in the following list (Atha et al., 2018, p. 26), can assist with the values and identity discernment process: What is important to me? What makes me feel fulfilled? What make me feel angry or indignant? What makes my life meaningful? What makes me feel fulfilled and gets my adrenalin flowing? What influences my decision-making process? How do I like to be treated? How do I treat others? 6.1.1 Activity: Read and Reflect Read Wheatley, M. (2017). Who Do We Choose to Be? : Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity. Oakland, CA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers. Opening pages 2-25; Chapters 1 (pages 28-61 and 2 (pages 63-97). As you read these pages think about a teacher, instructor or professor who is/was a leader in your eyes - someone you’ve most admired. What were their behaviours? How did you feel in their classroom? What kind of student were you, including the quality of what you produced? How do you feel about them now? Read the next learning activity below which is also related to this reading so you can keep it in mind as you read. 6.1.2 Activity: Read and Reflect As you read Wheatley (2017) answer the following questions in your Reflective Learning Journal: Write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to belonging. Choose the concept that you would like to apply in your own learning communities, both as a student and teacher/facilitator. Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions. As you prepare your discussion post, refer to these notes. 6.2 The Adult Educator as Creator and Leader of a Learner Centered Learning Environment Being ‘learner centered’ means teaching people not subjects. It means thinking about who is in your class, their prior knowledge about the topic, any fears or resistance they may bring to the topic and only then planning for facilitation of content. The person of the learner - not the curriculum - is the primary focus. A skillful educator however, will use the content to impact the learner and attain learning objectives. For adult educators who strive to be servant leaders, the undergirding value is human dignity, as philosopher Immanuel Kant admonishes: Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only. (Rachels, 1986, p. 1) Servant leadership is an appropriate model for adult educators who strive to: serve others by investing in their development and well-being for the benefit of the common good. … aspire to be great only in their service to others… with integrity, humility, sincere concern, a generous, forgiving and giving heart, and self-discipline… by investing, empowering, caring for, and consulting others. (Atha et al, 2018, p. 1) The resources you have in Brookfield, Silberman and Lipmanowiz and McCandess are learner centered in that their goal is learner engagement. Skillful adult educators try to avoid what Lipmanowicz and McCandless (2013) assert: Unwittingly, the conventional structures used to organize how people routinely work together stifle inclusion and engagement. Conventional structures are either too inhibiting (presentations, status reports and managed discussions) or too loose and disorganized (open discussions and brainstorms) to creatively engage people in shaping their own future. They frequently generate feelings of frustration and/or exclusion and fail to provide space for good ideas to emerge and germinate. (from http://www.liberatingstructures.com/home/) By incorporating liberating structures or those suggested by Brookfield and Silberman, you will indeed avoid methods and processes that stifle. Instead, you will liberate learners to express themselves and be transformed into agents of transformation. Strategies for engagement build confidence and can have a strong, positive impact on self-efficacy and identity in the sense of empowering learners to take action. As an adult educator you have a role of equipping leaders – whether for self-leadership or leadership with others. This broader view of the role can also be purpose-filled and motivating so embrace and enjoy it! 6.2.1 Activity: Strategies for Supporting Learners The belief in technology to fix the messes we’ve made and to save us from decline has been labeled by Ronald Wright, ‘The Progress Trap’ (Wheatley, p. 41). Wheatley’s point is that an over-reliance on technology is not helpful in the creation of an adult learning environment. What is then? Browse through the Brookfield, Silberman texts and the Liberating Structures website. Jot down in your journal what actions and strategies (whether technology-oriented or not) an adult educator can choose, to support and focus on people and relationships in a technologically-driven world. Unit 6 Summary In this unit, you have had the opportunity to learn about the adult educator as authentic leader and facilitator in the learning environment. You have considered the impact of identity in a learning environment and the adult educator as creator and leader of a learner centered environment. ✏️ Assessment Unit 6 Discussion After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to choose one of the two themes to write on: Do some research about a marginalized group related to your current or future working context.  What will be important for you to understand about this group in order to teach authentically in that space?  What indigenous perspectives need to be considered? Consider how your own identity impacts your ability to interact in this space.   OR Explore the concept of Assimilation Have you ever tried to hide your home language, religion or any other aspect of your family’s culture from your friends or classmates? If so, why? Describe the experience, how it felt, and what, if anything, about the situation you would change if you could. Post your response to the Discussion Forum and respond to at least two of your peers’ posts. 🎯 Checking your Learning Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit.

This relates to learning communities in that communication among individuals related to information and growth in learning communities is so important. To put it another way, if information is miscommunicated or growth misrepresented, then the learning community is likely to experience challenges. You will explore the role of adult educator to be an advocate for adult learners. You will also explore the concept of the adult educator as servant leader and the importance of intentional practice based on this model of leadership. A servant leader has the interests of followers at heart therefore will make a greater effort to communicate effectively and assess growth of the community and individual in a fair manner. 📖 Topics The Role of Information and Perception in Growth and Development The Adult Educator as Servant Leader 🎯 Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit you should be able to: Choose and/or design strategies with a critical lens for using information to influence growth and development of learners.

Activity 7.5: Respond in your discussion post for this unit. 7.1 The Role of Information and Perception in Growth and Development “Information is the source of all growth and development in a living system” (Wheatley, 2017, p. 101). Wheatley goes on to explain how information has changed from “communications among people to high speed transmissions delivered in cyberspace” (p. 104). While information is still important, it is the mode of delivery that has reshaped culture. She argues that the digital age has destroyed the information age. The adult educator can respond to her call to re-establish our relationships with the real world by choosing strategies that privilege connection and meaning and lead to better decisions. She illustrates this by describing in some depth the value of an ‘After Action Review’ (see pages 128-132). Consider how this might be adapted for the adult education setting in your context. Perception based on scientific understanding is not the only way of knowing. Wheatley admonishes: “There are other ways of knowing reality, reliable methods that have served humans and earlier hominids for millennia. It is the arrogance of our science that denies their existence and their usefulness” (p. 179). How can adult educators incorporate other ways of knowing? Cahalan, K. (2016) has identified eight ways of knowing that are essential to wise practice: Situated awareness is noticing and describing contextual factors. Embodied realizing is developing skilled competence in bodily action. Conceptual understanding is comprehending and remembering key information. Critical thinking is analyzing and evaluating concepts and actions. Emotional attunement is identifying and using awareness of feelings and affective states. Creative insight is developing imaginative and creative responses. Spiritual discernment is perceiving what is of God and not of God. Practical reasoning is problem-solving, forming judgments, gaining a sense of salience, and acting wisely. How we perceive, and teach learners to perceive, matters greatly and is a foundational responsibility of the adult educator. For example, in choosing texts, articles or other resources the type of information you get students to pay attention to will affect their awareness of contextual factors. Embodied realizing in the classroom may take the form of an experiential learning activity where the students are asked to interview someone, ‘shadow’ them for a time or else listen to a podcast and describe their ‘gut reactions’ or impressions. Reading biographies is an excellent way for learners to become more emotionally attuned to the feelings and affective states of others. This develops empathy – a crucial component of being hospitable in a diverse, pluralistic society. Wheatley identifies a warrior for the human spirit as “a decent human being who aspires to be of service in an indecent, inhumane time” (p. 255). In this sense, adult educators are called to be warriors for the human spirit. Read pages 258-259 for ethical principles that are quite likely to move you and profoundly influence your perception of your role. 7.1.1 Learning Activity Read Wheatley, M. (2017). Who Do We Choose to Be? : Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity. Oakland, CA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers.

Assignment 2: Company Website Analysis (20%). Analyze the learning culture of an organization. 8.1 Topic 1: Adult Education Methods to Teach from Depth What does it mean to teach from depth? It connects to the principle of adult learning that adults are internally motivated and build on prior life experience when they learn. Motivation is tapped into and amplified through reflective techniques and critical discussions that help the adult make sense of the new learning and situate it into what they already know. Asking thoughtful questions can lead this inquiry so that the learner constructs their own meaning. The facilitator of adult learning recognizes what Fenwick (2010) refers to as ‘the mess’ of learning and therefore strategically employs different levels of learning, making connections and establishing networks of information, while being aware of context and power dynamics. Teaching from depth means nurturing and valuing self-awareness, committing to self-reflection and mindfulness and practicing teaching from depth. This last point is important in order to balance reflection and introspection with action. Herminia Ibarra (2015) refers to this as ‘outsight’ (in contrast to insight) and argues that direct experiences and experimentation are important in order to develop external perspective. In the context of facilitating adult education this means trying out various strategies and learning through trial, error, refinement and adjustment. Where internal knowledge, past experience and thinking contribute to insight, external knowledge, new experience and acting contribute to outsight (p. 6). Teaching from depth involves developing insight and outsight – through utilizing both reflective practices and strategies and experiential learning. One strategy that can be used to teach for depth is called Stanislavski’s Magic If (Schuyler, p. 204). Stanislavski introduced method acting in the early twentieth century. This method, often referred to as role play, is where actors draw from their own life experiences to produce truthful actions and emotions. In the context of adult education, the learner imagines the circumstances of a particular learning experience and tries to figure out what to do in that situation. This technique is often applied in the classroom when case studies are utilized so that the learner’s life experiences are bridged via the imaginary situation, challenging the learner to construct and integrate new meaning while being solutions-focused. Among the many examples in Brookfield’s Discussion Book some of the strategies that foster teaching for depth include: - Snowballing p. 49, - Critical Incident Questionnaire (CIQ) p. 59, - Nominating Questions p. 77 and - Writing Discussion p. 157. I encourage you to review these particular strategies and add to your proverbial ‘toolkit.’ 8.1.1 Activity 8.1: Video :fa-film: View: Cason Smith, “The Six Adult Learning Principles.” plugin:youtube :fa-pencil: As you view this video, jot down the principles in your reflection journal for future reference when you complete the company website analysis assignment. Reflect one or two of these principles and consider how you might apply them to practice, and also how they relate to your “Philosophy of Learning Communities” you developed in Unit 5. 8.1.2 Activity 8.2: Reading Read Fenwick, T. (2010). Workplace ‘Learning’ and Adult Education: Messy Objects, blurry maps and making difference. European Journal for Research on the Education and Learning of Adults. I, 79-95. As you read this article, focus on the eight categories of workplace learning beginning on page 81 and only read the rest of the article if you are interested. Consider how these categories connect with the adult learning principles you looked at in your website analysis assignment. 8.1.3 Activity 8.3: Role Play Practice using role play by planning a teaching and learning activity that utilizes role play. Consider a discipline of interest to you or a concept of leadership that you want students to engage with further. Sketch out the directions to your future class for a role play activity. Alternatively, you may want to practice role play with a colleague, family member, or friend. Select a topic, such as belonging or community, and develop a role play to teach that concept within an online or face-to-face learning environment. 8.1.4 Activity 8.4: Company Website Analysis Assignment (20%) Investigate the Human Resources portion of a company’s website, a higher education institution or adult learning facility - preferably one with which you are familiar. Focus on the training and employee development part of the website. This assignment is meant to apply the theory of teaching in/for/with depth by looking at the learning culture of an organization. Here are some examples to get you started: McDonald’s: https://www.mcdonalds.com/ca/en-ca/careers/training-and-benefits.html TD Bank: https://jobs.td.com/en-CA/why-choose-us/training-development/ Starbucks: http://www.starbucks.com.hk/about-us/become-a-partner/learning-and-development Answer the following questions in your report: What can you infer about the company’s learning culture? From what is visible on the public website, would you say it is an authentic learning community? Why or why not? Discuss whether the website reflects aspects of one or more of the learning community models explored in previous lessons. Do you see evidence that interconnectedness and integrity are valued?  Explain. What traits and skills seem to be valued in employees? How does the company develop skills in its employees (e.g., workshops, seminars, mentoring)? Are the methods based on the principles of andragogy? (see Smith YouTube video). What specific adult learning strategies do you see reflected in the development/training opportunities for employees? Your paper should be 4-5 pages and should incorporate references to at least five scholarly sources you have studied in this course, or other scholarly sources you have identified. The paper should include: - Introduction - Analysis (responding to the prompts) - Conclusion - Reference List 8.2 Topic 2: Web of Relationships and Impact on Values We are who we are partly because of who we associate with. Perhaps you remember your parents cautioning you to choose your friends wisely. Perhaps you are a parent who understands this and has given similar advice to your own children. Even the contemporary business literature recommends that as adults we are aware of whom we choose to associate. In her book Executive Presence, Sylvia Ann Hewlett (2014) emphasizes how connections are fostered through eye contact, ‘commanding a room’ and ‘right-sizing your reputation.’ To deepen gravitas, the chief component of executive presence, she suggests “living intentionally, guided by a set of values… surround[ing] yourself with people who are better than you… [and] empower[ing] others’ presence to build your own” (p. 40-41). Our interconnectedness and relationships incrementally construct a living, learning, self-organizing group or organization (Wheatley, p. 226-240). Chapter 6 encourages us to prioritize collaboration, belonging and community. As adult educators and transformational servant leaders, we should heed this call to action for the benefit of our learners. Who we associate with impacts our values and our values have the potential to impact those with whom we associate. Being reliable, consistently following through on commitments is a foundational value that impacts and is impacted by the web of relationships we encounter in our work and life generally. Lytkina Botelho et al. (2017) did a ten-year study that identified specific attributes of high-performing CEOs. I would suggest that one of the attributes in particular can also describe high-performing adult educators and learners, that is, ‘delivering reliably’ (p. 10): “The ability to reliably produce results was possibly the most powerful of the four essential CEO behaviors.” (I encourage you to read the article to learn more about the other essential behaviors for CEO success: deciding with speed and conviction, engaging for impact and adapting proactively.). Consider how your values are impacted by your associates and how your values impact others. Wheatley emphasizes the power of this network: “people adopt the mores of a culture, even those that contradict their personal values. … The culture is in control, and most people unconsciously adapt” (p. 229). She encourages us to be conscious in our rebellion and reclaim life-affirming identities by being “fully engaged, carefully observing what’s going on as we do our work, learning from experience, applying those learnings, adapting, changing” (p. 231). How might you foster life-affirming identities in your particular learning environment? 8.2.1 Activity 8.5: Read and Reflect Read Chapter 6 (pages 211-243) of Wheatley, M. (2017). Who Do We Choose to Be: Facing Reality, Claiming Leadership, Restoring Sanity. Oakland, CA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers. As you read this chapter think about Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s comment “We exist in a bundle of life. We say, ‘A person is a person through other people.’ It is not ‘I think therefore I am’ \\[but rather\\] I am human because I belong. I participate, I share” (Wheatley, p. 223). 8.2.2 Activity 8.6: Unit 8 Discussion After reading Wheatley chapter 6, prepare the following for your discussion post: Who has influenced you to become the person you are? Who do you depend on as ground and support for your life? Demonstrate your network of relationships and annotate with the key values or wisdom you have learned from each person. Because of the influence of these individuals on your values, choose two (not previously described in your blog) strategies from Brookfield or Silberman and show how they align with these values. Create a concept map to show your networks of relationships using free Web 2.0 tools such as bubbl.us or popplet.com, or draw a concept map on paper, take a picture and include it in your post. Reflect on how this relates to your teaching/facilitating work. Unit 8 Summary In this unit, you have had the opportunity to learn about teaching with depth and the importance and role of interconnectedness and integrity. So much of the global culture is superficial. We tweet in 140 characters or less, we get our news in sound bytes and we have become experts at multi-tasking to the point of distraction. As adult educators we can and need to go deeper with our learners by being grounded in who we are and by designing learning that privileges collaboration, values and systems leading to growth and transformation. When we are intentional about doing this, we develop our web of interconnectedness and strengthen our personal and professional integrity. Powerful indeed! ✏️ Assessment Unit 8 Discussion After reading Wheatley chapter 6, prepare the following for your discussion post: Who has influenced you to become the person you are?
