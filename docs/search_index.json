Please consult the OWL Purdue website for guidance and seek assistance from the TWU Writing Center and writing coaches as needed. Assignments have rubrics that attribute some marks to APA formatting and cannot be graded as fully meeting expectations if there are APA errors. That said, your conceptual understanding remains of primary importance. It is your responsibility to ensure polished work to the highest standard of which you are capable. This demands meticulous attention to detail, which will become more natural with practice. Please seek any necessary clarification from your instructor. "],["learning-activity-bank.html", "Learning Activity Bank The Heart of a Teacher Belonging to Ones Self", " Learning Activity Bank The following activities are recommended for each unit. There are instructions in the course commentary, and your instructor may provide further direction. The Heart of a Teacher Activity 1.1 Reading and Reflective Learning Journal As we explore the importance of the inner life of the teacher as a foundation for authentic learning, read Chapter 1: The Heart of a Teacher: Identity and Integrity in Teaching in The Courage to Teach (Palmer, 2017). For this course, you will keep a Reflective Learning Journal, which will provide the basis for many of your discussion posts. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, organize, and integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, as you prepare for your future teaching/coaching. As you read, consider the following questions: In your Reflective Learning Journal, write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a teacher/facilitator/coach. Choose the concept that most resonates with you and write a short paragraph summary of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context. Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussion posts. As you prepare your discussion post, refer to these notes. Belonging to Ones Self Activity 2.1: Who are you? For this activity, you are asked to share a little more about yourself with your peers. First, find a quote about either identity or integrity. For example, you may want to perform a Google image search for identity quote. Find one that resonates with you, and then include a picture of something that tells us something about you. Post the quote and your image to the Unit 2 Discussion forum with a 1-2 sentence explanation. This is a non-graded activity, but may help you reflect on this topic and to prepare for the assignment in this unit. Activity 2.2 View and Reflect View the following resources and reflect on your learning: - Read. Brown, B. (2017). Chapter 1: Everywhere and Nowhere. - Watch: Maya Angelou: Interview with Bill Moyers (7 minutes). Activity 2.3: Vulnerability Video :fa-film: Watch the TedTalk by Brene Brown: (20 minutes) LINK  As you watch, consider the following questions: What elements of a learning community would create conditions for learners to be vulnerable about their fears about the course, their concerns about learning, and their questions regarding whether they are capable of achieving success in their course? In what ways do you feel vulnerable as a teacher/facilitator? Are there people with whom you can share this vulnerability? :fa-pencil: You may want to answer these questions in your Reflective Learning Journal, and refer back to them as you complete the assessment for this unit. Activity 2.4: Reading Brown (2017) argues that authenticity is essential to belonging. ! You will always belong anywhere you show up as yourself and talk about yourself and your work in a real way. !  Brene Brown (2017, p. 26) Activity 2.6: Listen and Reflect Listen to Brave, sung by Sara Bareilles. As you listen to this song, consider the following questions: Is there an area in my current professional work where I need to be brave and speak up? What fears would keep me from sharing my thoughts or experience? How will I create a learning community that allows learners to share their thoughts authentically? Activity 2.7: Self-Test Take the Clance Imposter Phenomenon test. As you take the test, consider the areas in which you feel vulnerable in your work as a learner. How would you address these concerns for learners in courses you facilitate? Activity 2.8: Readings Read: Gardner, B., Avolio, B., Luthans, F., May, D. &amp; Walumbwa, F. (2005) Can you see the real me? A self-based model of authentic leader and follower development. The Leadership Quarterly 16, pp. 343372. Optional Read: Cuddy, A. (2016). I dont deserve to be here: Presence and the imposter syndrome. Activity 2.9: Connection Activities &amp; Discussion Liberating Structures (Lipmanowicz &amp; McCandless, 2013) are used in collaborative learning and work environments to create space for all participants to engage in collaborative inquiry and unleash innovation. One of these Liberating Structures is the strategy of the Nine Whys, which allows participants to clarify what is important in their work. You may choose to use a strategy like this in your role as a facilitator and teacher. For this learning activity, however, you will use the strategy of the Nine Whys to consider your own identity as a teacher/facilitator. Identify someone in your life who knows you well, with whom you have a history of talking about your goals or dreams. Ask them to participate in this exercise with you. Begin by telling them why you are taking this course, as well as why you want to engage in teaching/coaching/facilitation. When you have finished talking, your Nine Whys partner will ask you: Why is that important to you? Your partner should continue asking that question up to nine times, or until you cannot go any deeper. At this point, you will have uncovered something fundamental about your identity as a teacher/facilitator. As you complete this exercise, take detailed notes in your Reflective Learning Journal. You will be asked to create a discussion post about this experience in the Unit 2 Assessment. "],["assessment-bank.html", "Assessment Bank Identity as a Teacher/Facilitator Company Website Analysis 0.1 Platform Paper", " Assessment Bank You instructor will provide instructions regarding how to complete the required assessments in this course. Identity as a Teacher/Facilitator Building on your learning in the first three weeks of class, write a 3-4 page paper in which you describe your identity as a teacher/facilitator.

Authenticity in Teaching and Learning 2. Identity and Integrity as a Coach/Facilitator Creating Authentic Learning Spaces Unit 1 Summary Assessment Checking your Learning", " Unit 1 The Heart of a Teacher Welcome to LDRS 664 Creating Authentic Learning Communities! As humans, we long for authenticity in our relationships. We want to feel at home in the organizations that are part of our lives  our families, schools, communities, places of worship. We seek connection. We search for a place where we are known. This sense of being at home is essential to our experience as learners. Deep, authentic learning happens in spaces where we feel connected with others  places and spaces where we are known. Palmer (1998) refers to this as the spiritual quest for connectedness (p. 5). In this course, we will explore together the theoretical foundations of learning communities, evaluating key elements essential to creating authentic learning communities, where learners are known and learning is authentic. In this unit, we will engage with the writings of Parker Palmer, a teacher and writer who has written several important works regarding the essential role of authenticity in teaching and learning. In addition to reading, throughout this course, we will also listen to music and view several short films that will allow us to more deeply engage with the concepts of belonging and authenticity within the teaching/learning experience. Topics Unit 1 focuses on two guiding questions: What does it mean to be authentic in teaching and learning? What is the facilitators role in creating spaces for authentic learning? Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit you should be able to: Describe your own personal identity as a facilitator/teacher. Identify your personal beliefs about your role as a facilitator/teacher. Discuss key elements of an authentic learning community. Activity Checklist These learning activities will engage you in considering the guiding questions for this unit. As you plan your week, be sure to include time for these important learning activities. Activities Activity 1.1: Read: Goode, Joanna: If you Build Teachers, will students come?. As you read, consider the following questions, and make some notes in your Reflective Learning Journal. When have you felt \"at home\" within a learning community? What elements made that learning space feel like \"home\"? What does it mean for you to be authentic as a teacher? How do we create authentic learning spaces? Activity 1.2: Reflect on your values. Activity 1.3: Rank the strategies listed to create an authentic learning space that is hospitable and open. Then, read: Herrington, J. &amp; Oliver, R. (2000). An instructional design framework for authentic learning environments.Educational Technology Research and Development. 48(3), pp 23-48. Assessment: Unit 1 Discussion: Incorporating the readings in this unit, you will write a 150-250 word discussion post that addresses your values related to teaching and learning and the key elements of authentic learning spaces. See the Assessments tab for full details. 1. Authenticity in Teaching and Learning Teaching and learning are deeply personal experiences. Learning is, by definition, a transformative experience; we change as a result of learning. Teaching is also a transformative experience; we change as a result of teaching. Authentic Learners Figure 1.1: Model designed by Penfold Navarro, C. (2018) In his book, The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teachers Life, Parker Palmer (2017) argues that the inner landscape of teaching is an essential foundation out of which authentic learning experiences emerge. ! Teachers possess the power to create conditions that can help students learn a great deal  or keep them from learning much at all. Teaching is the intentional act of creating those conditions, and good teaching requires that we understand the inner sources of both the intent and the act.  Palmer (2017, p. 7) 1.0.1 Learning Activity 1.1: Reading For this course, you will keep a Reflective Learning Journal, which will provide the basis for many of your blog posts. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, organize, and integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, as you prepare for your future teaching/coaching. Consider the following questions:  In your Reflective Learning Journal, write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a teacher/facilitator/coach.  Choose the concept that most resonates with you and write a short paragraph summary of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context.  Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and blog posts.  As you prepare your blog post, refer to these notes. 2. Identity and Integrity as a Coach/Facilitator Palmer (2017) argues that identity and integrity are foundational to good teaching. From Palmers perspective, this means we must endeavour to know ourselves and to create learning spaces that foster integrity in our students, allowing them to authentically engage with each other, with us, and with the discipline we are studying. In order to have integrity, we must know our own values and strengths, our own beliefs about teaching and learning, and our own perspective on the work we are doing. ! If the work we do lacks integrity for us, then we, the work, and the people we do it with will suffer.  Palmer (2017, p. 16) Learning Activity 1.2: Reflect and Respond As teachers, its important to identify and reflect on your own values. Consider why you are taking this course. Why do you want to coach/facilitate learning? What are your beliefs about learning? What are your values about learning? What are your strengths? Where do you need help? Take some time to answer the questions above in your Reflective Learning journal. Creating Authentic Learning Spaces ! For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known. 1 Corinthians 13:12 (ESV) As we begin thinking about creating authentic learning spaces, consider a time when you have felt at home within a learning community, whether in formal education, your faith community, or your employment. What elements made that learning space feel like home? In the song, *Home**, Phillip Phillips sings about the universal need we share as humans to belong. Take a moment now to listen to this song, considering what the lyrics say about what it means to belong. LINK !! Just know youre not alone !! Cause Im going to make this place your home. !! Phillip Phillips, In order for students to authentically learn, we must create learning spaces that are safe, where students know and feel that they belong. Palmer (1998) refers to this need for belonging as the spiritual quest for connectedness (p.5). If a sense of belonging provides a foundation for learning, then in our role as teachers, facilitators, or coaches, we must endeavour to create spaces where students know and feel that they belong. !!! Good teachers possess a capacity for connectedness. They are able to eave a complex web of connections among themselves, their subjects, and their students so that students can learn to weave a world for themselves.  Palmer (2017, p. 11) But how is this done? In To Know As We Are Known, Palmer (1993) suggests that learning spaces must include openness, boundaries, and an air of hospitality. These learning spaces, according to Palmer (1993) can be spaces both to be and to become (p. 71). Activity 1.3: Ranking Rank the following strategies according to your comfort level. For each strategy, list one practical action you can take in an online learning environment (as facilitator or learner) to create an authentic learning space that is hospitable and open. To study with a teacher who not only speaks but listens, who not only gives answers but asks questions and welcomes our insights, who provides information and theories that do not close doors but open new ones, who encourages students to help each other learn  to study with such a teacher is to know the power of a learning space (Palmer, 1997, pp. 70-71) Speaking Listening Giving answers Asking questions Providing information/theories that open doors Encouraging students to help each other learn As you read the discussion of authentic learning environments in Herrington and Oliver (2000), consider how the elements they discuss align with or differ from Palmers (2017) description of learning communities. Read Herrington, J. and Oliver, R. (2000). An instructional design framework for authentic learning environments. Questions to Consider After completing the activities above, consider the following questions: What are the important values that will guide my teaching/facilitation? What elements matter most to me in a learning community? What can I do to create hospitable learning spaces? Unit 1 Summary In this first unit, you have had the opportunity to think and learn about your identify and beliefs about your role as a facilitator/teacher, and consider key elements of authentic learning communities. The hunger for authentic human relationships and authentic learning can and should compel us to consider our own identity and integrity, both as teachers and learners. In our next unit, we will explore ideas related to vulnerability in leadership, and learning to be at home with ourselves so we can, in turn, lead and teach others. Assessment Unit 1 Discussion After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a discussion post on the following: ** Part 1** Incorporating the readings in this unit, write a 150-250 word discussion post that addresses the following: List and describe three values you hold related to teaching and learning. Write a personal statement about your identity as a coach/facilitator. Part 2 Consider the key elements of authentic learning spaces, outlined by Palmer (2017) in Chapter 3. Select two of these elements that you consider to be important. Introduce the element and discuss some practical steps you could take to create an authentic learning space. Respond to at least two other learners, providing additional suggestions regarding the elements they have chosen. Be sure to cite Palmer (2017) and other authors in both your initial posting and your responses to other learner to demonstrate ways in which your thinking aligns with, contrasts with, or builds on the writing of the authors. Your instructor will provide direction about how to complete this activity. Grading Criteria See the following rubric that explains how your discussion contributions will be evaluated. Checking your Learning Before you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to: - Describe your own personal identity as a facilitator/teacher. - Identify your personal beliefs about your role as a facilitator/teacher. - Discuss key elements of an authentic learning community.

Activity 2.9: Participate in the exercise, Nine Whys Assessment: Unit 2 Discussion: Write a discussion post on belonging and the Nine Whys activity. See the Assessments section for more details. Belonging to Myself In order to create authentic, safe learning spaces for others, we must first be comfortable with who we are. Identity: Knowing ourselves as teachers means that we must explore what Palmer (2017) calls the inner landscape. We must be aware of the character traits, personal experiences, values, beliefs, and cultural environment in which we were raised and now live. These elements are part of our identity  and we bring our identity with us into the classroom and learning spaces in which we coach and teach others (Palmer, 2017). Integrity: So, too, our integrity comes with us into the learning spaces in which we teach. Integrity, from Palmers (2017) discussion, is not about ethics, but about an integrated sense of self  a self that is whole, integrating life experiences and values and beliefs in a meaningful, authentic way. Whether we are aware of it or not, our integrity and identity are part of who we are as teachers. It is on this foundation that we build connections with students, and are able to invite them into spaces where personal transformation and authentic learning will take place. Authenticity is also an essential ingredient for effective leadership. Authentic leadership includes elements of both self-knowledge and identity, as well as collaboration with others within the context of relationship (Northhouse, 2019). Avolio, Walumbwa and Weber (2009) provide a model of authentic leadership that includes self-awareness, internalized moral perspective, balanced processing, and relational transparency (as cited in Northhouse, 2019, p. 198). However, even when we long to be vulnerable and authentic within our roles as teachers or leaders, we are often challenged by our own desire to project competence and strength, thinking that vulnerability and strength are mutually exclusive. Despite our need for authentic leaders and teachers, many of us remain reluctant to share any level of vulnerability  perhaps even more so when we are in positions of influence, as teachers, coaches, or leaders. In her book, Imposter Phenomenon: When Success Makes You Feel Like a Fake, Clance (1985) argues that many of us enter the arena of public engagement and career with concerns about whether we really belong. This fear often means we are afraid that being vulnerable or authentic will reveal to others that we do not truly belong in our roles. The first step to belonging, as seen in the work of Brown (2017) and Palmer (2017) is a sense of our own identity  including both our strengths and our areas of disconnection or discontent. Both these scholars urge us to understand our own humanity  to learn to trust ourselves and trust others (Brown, 2017, p. 37). As poet Maya Angelou discusses, belonging to ones self is an ongoing journey  a journey that is not always easy. ! I belong to myself. ! Maya Angelou, 1973 Activity 2.1: Who are you? For this activity, you are asked to share a little more about yourself with your peers. First, find a quote about either identity or integrity. For example, you may want to perform a Google image search for identity quote. Find one that resonates with you, and then include a picture of something that tells us something about you. Post the quote and your image to the Unit 2 Discussion forum with a 1-2 sentence explanation. This is a non-graded activity, but may help you reflect on this topic and to prepare for the assignment in this unit. Activity 2.2: View and Reflect View the following resources and reflect on your learning: - Read. Brown, B. (2017). Chapter 1: Everywhere and Nowhere. - Watch: Maya Angelou: Interview with Bill Moyers (7 minutes). Vulnerability in Learning Communities Learning to be vulnerable enough to share our authentic selves can be challenging  and knowing how much to be vulnerable (and when!) also poses a challenge, both in teaching and leadership. Students also wrestle with similar questions  How much of myself should I share in this class? This paper? This blog? Is this a safe space to express my own feelings of vulnerability? Authenticity is built on trust  spaces in which you are comfortable enough to share your true self  your identity. Brown (2017) argues that self-trust provides a foundation for belonging. Authenticity involves both owning ones personal experiences (values, thoughts, emotions and beliefs) and acting in accordance with ones true self (expressing what you really think and believe and behaving accordingly) (Harter, 2002, as cited in Gardner, Avolio, Luthans, May, and Walumbwa, 2005, pp. 344-5). Gardner et al. (2005) describe authentic leadership is demonstrated when relationships are characterized by: a) transparency, openness, and trust, b) guidance toward worthy objectives, and c) an emphasis on follower development (p. 345). If effective relationships include these characteristics, then authentic teachers and leaders must consider what it means to be transparent and open, as well as what it means to extend trust. Activity 2.3: Vulnerability Video :fa-film: Watch the TedTalk by Brene Brown: (20 minutes) LINK  As you watch, consider the following questions: What elements of a learning community would create conditions for learners to be vulnerable about their fears about the course, their concerns about learning, and their questions regarding whether they are capable of achieving success in their course? In what ways do you feel vulnerable as a teacher/facilitator? Are there people with whom you can share this vulnerability? :fa-pencil: You may want to answer these questions in your Reflective Learning Journal, and refer back to them as you complete the assessment for this unit. Activity 2.4: Reading Brown (2017) argues that authenticity is essential to belonging. ! You will always belong anywhere you show up as yourself and talk about yourself and your work in a real way. !  Brene Brown (2017, p. 26) As you read Brown (2017) Chapter 2, answer the following questions in your Reflective Learning Journal: Write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to belonging. Choose the concept that you would like to apply in your own learning communities, both as a student and teacher/facilitator. Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions. As you prepare your discussion post, refer to these notes. Activity 2.5 Sharing your Identity Being vulnerable involves sharing something of our true selves, which we might not always be comfortable doing in certain environments. In your Reflective Learning Journal, consider a time when you were your true self in a professional or personal setting in which you wondered if you really belonged. Perhaps this is a time when shared your spoke up about an issue that was important to you, lead a team in a new direction, or created a process that felt more authentic to you. What part of yourself did you share? How did this make you feel vulnerable? What were the results? Creating Connections with Learners In our role as teachers, we are asked to connect students with new ways of thinking and knowing, as well as new knowledge. But the first (and perhaps most important) connections we make (and the connections on which all learning is built) are connections between students, and between students and teachers. ! Good teachers join self and subject and students in the fabric of life. !  Parker Palmer (1998, p. 11) Leadership, like teaching, relies not just on the relationships that teachers form with learners, but also on the identity of the teacher. Authentic leaders understand their own values and behave toward others based on these values (Northouse, 2019, p. 201). These relationships will form the basis for learning in the classroom. Learning is, at its heart, a personal activity. Learners often experience vulnerability as they enter into (and continue through) the learning experience, wondering if they belong, if they are up to the challenge, and if they will succeed. Activity 2.6: Listen and Reflect Listen to Brave, sung by Sara Bareilles. As you listen to this song, consider the following questions: Is there an area in my current professional work where I need to be brave and speak up? What fears would keep me from sharing my thoughts or experience? How will I create a learning community that allows learners to share their thoughts authentically? Activity 2.7: Self-Test Take the Clance Imposter Phenomenon test. As you take the test, consider the areas in which you feel vulnerable in your work as a learner. How would you address these concerns for learners in courses you facilitate? Activity 2.8: Readings Read: Gardner, B., Avolio, B., Luthans, F., May, D. &amp; Walumbwa, F.

Activity 2.9: Connection Activities &amp; Discussion Liberating Structures (Lipmanowicz &amp; McCandless, 2013) are used in collaborative learning and work environments to create space for all participants to engage in collaborative inquiry and unleash innovation. One of these Liberating Structures is the strategy of the Nine Whys, which allows participants to clarify what is important in their work. You may choose to use a strategy like this in your role as a facilitator and teacher. For this learning activity, however, you will use the strategy of the Nine Whys to consider your own identity as a teacher/facilitator. Identify someone in your life who knows you well, with whom you have a history of talking about your goals or dreams. Ask them to participate in this exercise with you. Begin by telling them why you are taking this course, as well as why you want to engage in teaching/coaching/facilitation. When you have finished talking, your Nine Whys partner will ask you: Why is that important to you? Your partner should continue asking that question up to nine times, or until you cannot go any deeper. At this point, you will have uncovered something fundamental about your identity as a teacher/facilitator. As you complete this exercise, take detailed notes in your Reflective Learning Journal. You will be asked to create a discussion post about this experience in the Unit 2 Assessment. Unit 2 Summary In this unit, we have explored the importance of identity, authenticity, and vulnerability in creating authentic learning communities. Our own identity as a teacher will go with us into the classroom, and we will be able to build on our own abilities to create connections as we share our authentic selves with students. In the next unit, we will focus on strategies to create a sense of belonging among students, building on our own understanding of vulnerability to create spaces where students, too, can bring their authentic selves to the learning experience. Assessment Unit 2 Discussion Part 1: Belonging After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a discussion post on the following: Referring to Brown (2017) Chapter 2, answer the following questions: Write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to belonging. Choose the concept that you would like to apply in your own learning communities, both as a student and teacher/facilitator. Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and discussions. Part 2: Liberating Structure Activity In this unit, you were asked to use the strategy of the Nine Whys to consider your own identity as a teacher/facilitator. You asked a friend/family member to help you with this activity, asking questions about your engagement with this course and teaching/coaching/facilitation. Write 250 word discussion post on this process, including your why for teaching/facilitating. Grading Criteria See the following rubric that explains how your discussion contributions will be evaluated. Checking your Learning Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit. Can you: articulate a sense of identity as a teacher/facilitator? analyze the influence of teacher authenticity on student learning?

A facilitator is expert on process and group interactions. In education, facilitation is rooted in understanding the nature of the social learning process and how to guide its direction and quality. As a social species, we learn a great deal from each other in both formal and informal contexts. Our earliest learning experiences are profoundly social and intimate interactions between mother and child, and the social aspect of learning never ceases to be important. During this unit, we will examine a short history of social theories of learning from John Dewey and Lev Vygotsky, then, we will experiment with the theory and practices of facilitating learning in group settings. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Social Theories of Learning Cooperative Learning Facilitating Transformational Learning in Group Settings Navigating Group Dynamics Core Facilitation Competencies Strategies for Learning Facilitation Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit, you should be able to: Explain how to design learning environments to maximize learning Plan appropriate group learning processes to support transformative learning. Demonstrate how to facilitate a course of study. Design cooperative activities to maximize student-student and student-content interactions Apply knowledge of the Community of Inquiry model liberating structures to the facilitation of cooperative learning activities Identify and explain core competencies for facilitating learning. Resources Online resources will be provided in the unit. 3.1 Topic 1 - Social theories of learning The idea that learning is a social process can be traced way back in time, but formal descriptions of social constructivism, as it has been called, are often traced to John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky. Albert Bandura also contributed via social learning theory. What is social constructivism? Vygotsky (1978) argues that every function in the childs cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later on the individual level; first between people (interpsychologically), and then inside the child (intrapsychologically) (p. 57). That is, humans learn first through social observations and interactions, which they later internalize as their own thinking. The significance of Vygotskys insight is that, instead of focusing on the study of psychological entities such as skills, concepts, information-processing units, reflexes, or mental functions, it assumes that we must begin with a unit of activity (Wertsch, 1985). This idea of activity, or to be more precise the active participation of the learner, is central to our emerging understanding of learning as a process of socially constructing knowledge. Central to this progress is language, which we first learn in the context of social interactions, then, we adopt as self-talk for self-direction and self-regulation, and ultimately internalized as our own inner speech (Vygotsky &amp; Kozulin, 1986, p. 228). Similarly, Bandura (1977) argues social role modeling is central to how most behaviors are learned, from observing others one forms an idea of how new behaviors are performed, and on later occasions this coded information serves as a guide for action. In sum, we may conclude that knowledge is constructed first socially, then, personally, by learners as they encounter new information, compare it to old models that they may have, and develop new understandings of how the world works. It is not the case that new knowledge is simply copied intact from one mind to another, rather new information is integrated into old understandings, bringing about a hybrid of the two. This is essentially what we understand as a constructivist model of learning. Zone of Proximal Development Social constructivism builds on the constructivist model, adding the idea that this process of integrating new understandings with old understandings is best understood as a social process. Vygotsky (1978) introduced the idea that people with a greater capacity to understand the world and cope with its challenges act as supportive structures, which enable others to construct and internalize the knowledge these people have. This new construction occurs within what Vygotsky refers to as an individuals zone of proximal development, which he differentiated from their zone of actual development. The ZPD is the sweet spot in education where a student is optimally challenged to learn. If the task is too easy for the student, and they have already mastered it, then learning activities will not result in learning. Conversely, if a task is so difficult that the student cannot complete it, even with assistance, learning activities will not result in learning. In the middle are tasks that a student is able to complete, but only with the assistance of a more capable peer or expert. This is the Zone of Proximal Development: alt-text Scaffolding A metaphor that has been used to describe one such supportive mechanism is scaffolding. A scaffold is a way for educators to support the construction of new knowledge, beginning from a persons existing repertoire of knowledge and then preceding into new heights of understanding. The scaffold is the environment an educator creates, the support of learning facilitation, and the processes and language that are lent to the learner in the context of approaching an adaptive task and developing new abilities to meet it (Wilhelm, Baker, &amp; Dube, 2001). Furthermore, scaffolding implies not only a persons specific relation to the modeled behavior of others; it implies a persons relation to social communities, and it implies becoming a full participant, a member, a kind of person (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1996). The task of facilitating learning with the ZPD in mind assumes that you, as the facilitator, know what knowledge and skills your students are starting with. It is likely that the competencies your students display fall along a bell curve. While most students will be learning within a similar ZPD, there will be outliers at both ends of the curve. One strategy can be to pair students whose skills and knowledge are below the curve with those above the curve. In doing this, students who are above the curve, who may not be challenged with the content or skill, have to engage in greater levels of cognitive complexity in order to concisely explain to their peer and help them to meet the objective. For example, Madland and Richards (2016) describes a cooperative peer review activity, where the authors asked a group of learners how they thought cooperative learning activities supported learning. In this study, the learners responses indicated that the two most important factors were social cohesion and developmentally appropriate challenges, indicating that learners recognized the importance of the ZPD in learning. 3.1.1 Questions to Consider After reading the topic above, consider the following question: How does the idea of the zone of proximal development help you support learning? 3.2 Topic 2 - Cooperative Learning Cooperative learning is a set of learning facilitation strategies that are focused on encouraging educative social interactions between learners. It is important to not conflate cooperative learning with group projects as you might remember them from your previous experiences as a university student. Group projects are often assigned because faculty seem to have a sense that working together is a good thing for students, along with a vague sense that modern jobs all require teamwork. Too often, they amount to repurposing an individual assignment (such as, a research paper) into the same task, but with multiple people handing in one item instead of three to four. When these tasks are not well structured, the process becomes problematic. We have all likely experienced less-than-ideal group projects where one or two people do most of the work, one member is seemingly absent altogether, and anothers work is of poor quality. This is not the kind of learning activity that inspires highly engaged learners. Contrary to this dysfunctional group learning model, cooperative learning is structured in a way that maximizes effort from all students and, ideally, leads to all group members attaining high-level learning outcomes. In order to ensure this, there are five characteristics of learning groups that must be present for cooperative learning to occur: positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interactions, appropriate use of social skills, and group processing (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009, p. 366). More about cooperative learning Positive Interdependence Positive interdependence, according to Johnson and Johnson is the idea that individuals in a learning environment are dependent upon each other for success. In other words, I cannot succeed unless you succeed and you cannot succeed unless I succeed. So, collectively, we are interdependent. Positive interdependence is the key that distinguishes cooperative learning from competitive learning, where students are graded on a curve and only the top 2-3% of students can earn A grades. Individual and Group Accountability In cooperative learning environments, each individual in the group is held accountable for their contributions to the final product, and feedback is provided to both the individual and the group. This helps to ensure that students who need more assistance are identified and can be supported as needed, and it also prevents the social loafing that is common in typical group projects. Promotive Interaction Promotive interaction is the logistics of working and learning together as a cooperative group. The essence is that group members each need to work to promote the learning of each other member of the group. Since each person will be held accountable for their work and the entire group will only succeed if each member succeeds, there is a natural social pressure on more experienced members of the group to assist those with less experience or knowledge. Interpersonal Skills Not only do members of the group need to learn the content of the lesson or project, but they must also learn the process of working well as a cooperative group. Sometimes, these processes need to be taught directly, other times (like in graduate studies) it is reasonable to presume that group members will already possess and be willing to utilize effective social skills. Group Processing Finally, the group must be able to monitor their process with the goal of improving their work process and product. This metacognitive task is crucial to the long-term improvement and progress towards learning goals. Learning Activity Questions to Consider After reading through the content in Topic 2, please consider the following questions: How can coaching concepts be applied to helping learners learn? What key characteristics define effective coaching for learning? How can educators coach learners through the transition of making a change? 3.3 Topic 3 - Facilitating Transformational Learning in Group Environments In Unit One, we examined the CoI model and identified how teaching presence helps to support both the cognitive and social presences within the educational experience of a course of study. An important idea we emphasized was that teaching presence can be a shared function between members of the learning community and that facilitation of the learning process is often shared (Garrison, et al., 2010). Now, we are interested in examining what a division of the teaching presence might look like if we professionalize the function of learning facilitation within a distributed model of teaching presence. Our prototype for exploring this model is TWUs own Facilitated Academic Resource (FAR) centre. The facilitation of courses in the TWU FAR Centre model is unique, as you know. From the perspective of a traditional, campus-based faculty member in Langley, a FAR Centre course is an online course. The faculty member has worked in the role subject matter expert with an instructional designer to structure a course which integrates everything required to create an online community of inquiry with allowances for all three presences: social, cognitive, and teaching. The courses are deployed through online technology and materials are accessed digitally in remote locations. Furthermore, students submit their work to the faculty member who then assesses their work and provides both formative and summative feedback as appropriate. From the perspective of the remote student, however, the course is much more like a typical F2F course where they are meeting with a group of their fellow students in regularly scheduled learning labs in a central location and are guided through the learning materials by an experienced facilitator. The rationale for this model is that international students often experience difficulties completing online courses from Western universities, so TWU is providing a F2F Academic Facilitator to support remote students in their individual and group studies through the courses. You, as the Academic Facilitation Specialist, are a critical component of this model. Your skills in coaching facilitating student learning through courses where you may not be a subject matter expert are going to be extremely important. As such, you will need to start thinking about how to facilitate your students experience of a course of studys learning activities without the immediate F2F presence of a faculty member. In the activity below, you will read about the concept and practices of facilitating transformation learning. Facilitating Group Learning Sessions The work of facilitating the learning process within a group setting begins with an effective plan. Smith (2009) proposes a simple model: EFFECT. This model reminds the facilitator to think about the learning environment, the focus (or purpose) of the session, feelings the session is likely to evoke, experiences learners will explore, changes learners will make as a result of the session, and the timings allocated for all the learning experiences and activities. Next, its important for the facilitator to plan out the structure of each learning session, which like a story, should have beginnings, middles, and endings. Each stage has a particular task. The beginning encourages learners to explore, the middle engages learners with the subject, and the ending enables learners to move on in their personal learning journey. Drawing upon Evans (2007) guidelines for helping conversations, Smith (2009) advises facilitators to think about the exploration as the first quarter of the session; engaging with the subject and developing understanding as the middle half; and enabling action and development as the final quarter. 3.4 - Learning Activity Read and Reflect Read the following article: Facilitating Learning and Change in Groups Questions to Consider After completing the reading above, consider the following questions: According to Roger Schwarz what is a facilitators main task? According to Carl Rogers what are the core conditions for facilitating learning? What are the three foci of the facilitator role? What are the core values informing facilitation? How can the EFFECT model help you to plan a facilitated learning session? How does a facilitator effectively structure a facilitated learning session? 3.5 Topic 4 - Navigating Group Dynamics In this Unit we have examined how individual learning may be understood as a social process, however, it is also important for facilitators to understand that the group as a whole also learns and develops. Forsyth (2017) defines a social group as two or more individuals who are connected to one another by and within social relationship (p. 3). The number of group members, the presence of links between members, and the nature of those links all shape the group and the quality of learning it supports. An essential requirement for learning in a group is a sufficient level of cohesion and trust between members. Some of the group characteristics that tend to cultivate trust within a group include: Similarity - The more similar members are in terms of age, sex, education, skills, attitudes, values, and beliefs, the more likely the group will bond. Stability - The longer a group stays together, the more cohesive it becomes. Size - Smaller groups tend to have higher cohesion. Support - Coaching and encouragement to support other members strengthens the groups identity. Satisfaction - How pleased group members are with each others performance, behaviour, and conformity to group norms increases cohesion. One factor that tends to erode trust within a group is: Social Loafing - There is a tendency of individuals to put in less effort when working in a group context. As group size grows, this effect becomes larger. Group Development It is important for facilitators to understand that groups change over time. One of the most influential and helpful models of group development was articulated by Bruce W. Tuckman (1965). His research finding was that groups typically move through five critical stages of development: Forming: Members get to know one another, exchange personal information, and establish new relationships. Storming: Members open up to each other and confront each others ideas and perspectives. Norming: Members achieve a consensus about goals, definition of roles, and clear coordination of effort. Performing: The group is able to function as a unit as they find ways to get the job done smoothly and effectively without inappropriate conflict or the need for external facilitation. Adjourning: At some point the group ends. ! Each stage of group development requires the facilitator to employ variations in their approach. 3.6 - Learning Activity Read and Reflect Take a moment to read the following article: What is a Group? Questions to Consider After reading the article above, consider the following questions: What are some of the key benefits and dangers of learning in group settings? What are some key dimensions of groups? What are the stages of group development? 3.7 - Learning Activity Read and Reflect Take a moment to read the following article: Comfort Zone to Performance Management Questions to Consider After completing the reading above, consider the following questions: How is Whites Optimal Performance Zone similar Vygotskys ZPD? How does Whites model help a facilitator determine how to adjust their facilitation strategies? What insight does Whites model provide about how to sustain learning performance? 3.8 Topic 5 - Core Facilitation Competencies The professionalization of learning facilitation within educational settings is a promising, but new development. The core competencies are still emerging, as institutions begin to prototype this model. Below is a tentative list of competencies we have identified through in our preliminary experiments. Develop multi-session study plans for completing courses Select clear study methods and learning activities Prepare time and space to support group learning Create and sustain a participatory transformative learning environment Guide Group to meet each course learning outcome Directing processes for sharing peer feedback (in self-directed learning) Providing learners with formative feedback Mediating exchange of coursework and feedback between students &amp; instructor 3.9 - Learning Activity Take some time to read the following article: Core Competencies Questions to Consider - After completing the reading above, consider the following questions: - What general facilitation competencies apply to facilitating learning? - What competencies do you feel are strength areas? What areas do you need to develop? - How can facilitation skills help you support learner success in an educational setting? 3.10 Topic 6 - Facilitation Strategies Strategies for facilitating learning are as numerous and varied as the educators who create them. In the FAR model of professionally facilitated learning we are proposing in this course, each FAR course you may help facilitate in the future has a facilitators guide that provides designs for each learning activity. While these designs provide you with the majority of the learning facilitation strategies required in a given course, the needs of learners are not always predictable and emergent strategies may be needed. Liberating Structures It can often be challenging to devise new ways of interacting in F2F learning environments, but there are many resources available to facilitators both online and in print. One of those resources is a book and website called Liberating Structures which describes a set of 33 structured activities that you can use in your learning labs to generate conversation without resorting to the same old tired brainstorm. 3.11 - Learning Activity Watch and Reflect Watch the video below for a quick introduction to Liberating Structures: Next, visit the Liberating Structures website and take a look at the following activity: What, So What, Now What? W³ Now, consider how could you use this Liberating Structure to guide a group discussion that would help learners learn a Unit? 3.12 Unit 2 Assessment Please see the details for Post 1 below for your first required reflective post. plugin:content-inject In addition, you should be planning your Curriculum analysis assignment with your learning pod. plugin:content-inject Checking Your Learning Before you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to: Explain how to design learning environments to maximize learning.

A learning community can be created within a specific course, academic program, or professional context. Learning communities can be found across university campuses and often include a set of interdisciplinary, paired-courses that students take as a cohort. They can be grounded in residence halls with an integration of living and learning. Or, they can be developed in formal educational environments with a focus on students learning together as a cohort. Professional learning communities have also emerged as an important force in education and other fields, as colleagues gather around a shared interest, a focus on continuous quality improvement, and a shared discipline. Learning communities are authentic, emotionally-safe and inclusive spaces (whether physical or virtual) where learners and teachers come together to engage in deep learning. By definition, a learning community includes both LEARNING and COMMUNITY. Unit 4 focuses on 2 guiding questions: What is a learning community? What key elements are essential to learning communities? 4.1 Topics In this unit, our topics explore three different models of learning communities. Pyramid Model of Learning Communities (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998) The Community of Truth (Palmer, 2017) Trinity Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017) 4.2 Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit you should be able to: Describe elements of an authentic learning community. Compare learning community models. 4.3 Learning Activity Checklist These learning activities will engage you in considering the guiding questions for this unit. As you plan your week, be sure to include time for these important learning activities.  | Activities |  |  |  | Activity 4.1: Read What IS a Learning Community? (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998) and respond in your Reflective Journal. |  | Activity 4.2: Read: Palmer, P. (2017) The Courage to Teach,  Chapter 4 Knowing in Community and respond in your Reflective Journal. |  | Activity 4.3: Trinity Model of Collaborative Inquiry and respond in your Reflective Journal. |  | Activity 4.4: Complete your Discussion post and respond to two other peers. | 4.4 Learning Community Pyramid The Learning Community Pyramid, developed by Brower &amp; Dettinger (1998) includes academic, social, and physical components. They describe academic components as those that focus on the curriculum and learning that takes place. The social components are the elements of trust and inclusivity that create space for community. The physical component is the place or facility where the community meets or resides (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998, p. 17). In the case of this course, that place is the course hub. Building on the foundation of social, physical, and academic elements, Brower and Dettinger (1998) contend that learning communities also include three areas of responsibility: ethical responsibility, civic responsibility, and professional responsibility (p. 17). According to Brower &amp; Dettinger (1998), Learning communities, to be considered as such, must integrate academic subject matter and social interactions while providing the physical space or facility for an intellectually stimulating environment to emerge. Furthermore, learning communities must be designed to develop a triad of responsibilities within studentsprofessional, ethical, and civic (p. 16). As you consider the learning community you will facilitate, consider how you might develop or model professional, ethical, and civic responsibility within that community. Do you think leaders should develop these same areas of responsibility with the organizations or companies they lead? 4.4.1 Learning Activity 4.1 Read What IS a Learning Community? (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998). In your Reflective Journal, write down three strengths of this learning community model. Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community. Do you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create? Why or Why not? As we compare the other two models, feel free to organize your thoughts into a chart such as the following: Strengths of model Aspects Unique to this Model Questions Learning Community Pyramid (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998) Community of Truth model (Palmer, 2017) Trinity Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017) 4.5 The Community of Truth (Palmer, 2017) Palmers learning community model (2017) incorporates both learning and community with a subject as the center, surrounded by knowers who are in relationship to both each other and the subject. Palmer (2017) assets that the community of truth, far from being linear and static and hierarchical, is circular, interactive, and dynamic (p. 106). Figure 4.1: Palmers Community of Truth model. From https://uncc.instructure.com/courses/342/pages/module-3-why-discussions The learning that takes place in this model is captured in this statement: I understand truth as the passionate and disciplined process of inquiry and dialogue itself, as the dynamic conversation of a community that keeps testing old conclusions and coming into new ones (p. 106). As teachers, we approach teaching with some sense that we have some thing (some subject) to teach students. Palmer (2017) challenges us to think differently about the teaching/learning experience. (See The Objectivist Myth of Knowing, p. 103 and The Community of Truth, p. 105). Instead of solely focusing on what we must teach (and what students must learn), Palmer challenges us to consider how we all might learn something more together  more than is already known  through the teaching/learning experience. In this way, we must consider that we are not just engaged in transferring information or knowledge, but that (in addition to that), together we might create new knowledge. ! I know of no field, from science to religion, where what we regard as objective knowledge did not emerge from long and complex communal discourse that continues to this day, no field where the facts of the matter were delivered fully formed from on high (Palmer, 2017, p. 107). Palmers (2017) model highlights the relational knowledge of learning communities, underscoring not just the relationship of the people involved, but also the relationships between people and subject. As you consider facilitating learning communities, give some thought to your own relationship to the subject to be taught and learned. Consider whether you know this subject objectively or subjectively. 4.5.1 Learning Activity 4.2: Read The Courage to Teach, Chapter 4 Knowing in Community (Palmer, 2017). In your Reflective Journal, write down three strengths of this learning community model. Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community. Do you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create? Why or Why not? 4.6 The TWU Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017) In our online courses, Trinity Western University seeks to create learning communities that engage student learning on a cognitive, social, and spiritual level. The TWU Community of Inquiry model is a visual representation of these three aspects of learning (Social, Cognitive, and Spiritual), and how they interact with each other. At the intersections of these elements, you find: Community of Inquiry Community of Faith Integration of Faith and Reason Combined, these three elements can lead to transformational learning  an aspiration we hold in this course and program  and a fundamental goal of higher education in a broader sense.

In your Reflective Journal, write down three strengths of this learning community model. Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community? Do you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to create? Why or Why not? 4.6.2 Activity 4.4: Discussion Post After completing Learning Activities 4.1-3, write a 250-word discussion post. Provide a brief description of each of the three models (with citations as appropriate). Select the learning community model that most closely aligns with your identity and values as a teacher/facilitator. In your post, tell your readers the strengths you see in this model, explaining why it resonates with your concepts of teaching and learning. 4.7 Unit 4 Summary The learning community models we have considered in this unit share some similarities. In each model, there is an awareness that learners and learning is multidimensional. As we engage in teaching and learning, we must always be aware that the learning process is, fundamentally, transformative. It engages people, not only on an intellectual level, but also on a spiritual and social level. By designing curriculum, pedagogy, and learning around all aspects of learning  social, cognitive, and spiritual  we provide the foundation for transformational learning. Palmer (2017) puts it this way: The reality we belong to, the reality we long to know, extends far beyond human beings interacting with one another This is a community held together not only by our personal powers of thought and feeling but also by the power of the grace of great things (p. 109). As Palmer (2017) points out, learning includes both thought (cognitive) and feeling (social), but also something beyond those  the overarching spiritual nature of life and learning. 4.8 Assessment 4.8.1 Unit 4 Discussion After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a 250-word discussion post on the following: Provide a brief description of each of the three models (with citations as appropriate). Select the learning community model that most closely aligns with your identity and values as a teacher/facilitator. In your post, tell your readers the strengths you see in this model, explaining why it resonates with your concepts of teaching and learning. 4.8.1.1 Grading Criteria See the following rubric that explains how your discussion contributions will be evaluated. 4.9 Checking your Learning Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit.

Activity 5.6: Student Interview and Unit 5 Discussion 5.1 Creating Collaborative Learning in an Online Environment In our role as a teacher or facilitator, we are engaged in leading learners through a transformational educational process. Collaborative Inquiry is a process through which we, as educators, engage in learning about the practice of teaching through collaborative inquiry and reflection (Donohoo &amp; Velasco, 2016). Athabasca University defines a Community of Inquiry as a group of individuals who collaboratively engage in purposeful critical discourse and reflection to construct personal meaning and confirm mutual understanding (Athabasca University, n.d.). While Collaborative Inquiry is often used to describe a process used by professional learning communities to guide organizational change  or to describe Communities of Practice among educators  collaborative inquiry is also a practice that can be implemented within classrooms. The fields of Collaborative Inquiry (Donohoo &amp; Velasco, 2016) and Appreciative Inquiry (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010) are built on the premise that we must all collaborate together in a community of learners, and that by doing so, we can generate learning that goes beyond what we might learn on our own. It is a strengths-based approach to learning and change that has been described as unifying moments when joy touches joy, strength touches strength, health touches health, inspiration combines with inspiration  and how to make the combinations happen more rapidly and frequently (Cooperrider, D., as cited in Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xiii). Palmers (2017) Community of Truth that we explored in the last unit, incorporates the essence of collaborative learning, underscoring the importance of relationship within education. He writes, What seems right for me, after many years of searching, is to sit in a circle with my students (or try to relate to the crowd in a lecture hall as if we were in a circle) and lead an inquiry into the great thing in our midst, But there are other ways to create community in the classroom, and some of them look nothing like the interactive encounter we normally associate with that word (p. 139). Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom cast a compelling vision for collaborative environments where the act of engaging in appreciative inquiry can transform communities. They write: Appreciative Inquiry transforms organizations into places that are free and alive, where people are eager and filled with positive power, and where the creativity of the whole never ceases to amaze, surprise, and innovate (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. xi). Learning communities, too, can become places that are free and alive, where all members of the community engage in challenging, authentic learning. Appreciative Inquiry (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010) is built on eight principles, which can inform the way we support learners in an online learning context. These include: The Constructionist Principle The Simultaneity Principle The Poetic Principle The Anticipatory Principle The Positive Principle The Wholeness Principle The Enactment Principle The Free-Choice Principle (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52). These principles can serve as a guide for facilitating online discussions, designing lessons, and providing formative feedback to learners. For example, the Simultaneity Principle is based on the premise that by its nature, asking questions not only leads to change, but the very act of engaging in inquiry is, in fact, the first step in change. According to this principle, the moment we ask a question, we begin to create a change (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52). Likewise, the Free-Choice Principle contends that people perform better and are more committed when they have freedom to choose how and what they contribute (Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010, p. 52). Facilitating discussions that allow learners to engage in conversation (whether face-to-face or online), determine some aspects of their assignments, select topics, etc., can have a powerful influence on student engagement with learning. 5.1.1 Learning Activity Read: Palmer, P. (2017) The Courage to Teach, Chapter 5 Teaching in Community; Chapter 6 Learning in Community, Chapter 7 Divided No More. In your Reflective Journal, make notes on the following questions: What specific actions could you take to invite students in to the community of truth? What questions can I ask to invite students to engage in collaborative, inquiry-based learning? 5.1.2 Learning Activity Review the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry from the Appreciative Inquiry Commons at Champlain University, or in Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom. (2010). The power of appreciative inquiry: A practical guide to positive change. Select two of the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry. In a 250-word blog post, describe a learning activity you would conduct with your class that integrates both of these principles. For example, how would you design a writing assignment that included Positive Principle? Or, describe an assignment through which you ask students to create a short video that incorporates the Poetic Principle. 5.2 Supporting Connections Between Learners Creating a positive, open, learning environment is a critical component for fostering authentic learning  a place where we can both belong to ourselves and to others. Brown (2017) poses these questions: Are we willing to show up and be seen when we cant control the outcome? Are we willing to create courageous spaces so we can be fully seen? (p. 154) Palmer (2017), offers five suggestions for ways in which we can prepare students for engagement in authentic communities  both in education, our places of work, and our communities. We must help our students debunk the myth that institutions process autonomous, even ultimate, power over our lives. We must validate the importance of our students emotions as well as their intellect. We must teach our students how to mine their emotions for knowledge. We must teach them how to cultivate community or the sake of both knowing and doing. We must teach  and model for  our students what is meant to be on the journey toward an undivided life. (p. 205). In this course, we are exploring concepts of education that include our emotional experiences with learning, the importance of community, the nature of knowledge, and the foundational importance of the teachers authenticity. For some academics, the acknowledgement of the emotional experience of education can be challenging, according to Palmer, who argues that the feelings we have influence our learning. Donohoo and Velasco (2016), in their work on Collaborative Inquiry, also underscore the importance of acknowledging the emotional experiences of student. There is no doubt that learning is interrupted when negative emotions and attitudes surface, as such feelings hinder our ability to make sense of things (Donohoo and Velasco, 2016, p. 36). 5.2.1 Learning Activity For this activity, you will spend some time reflecting on your own experience as a learner, in order to consider the needs of the students you lead in online and face-to-face learning environments. So pick up your Reflective Learning Journal, grab your laptop, and settle down into a comfy chair (or sit among some trees). Watch the short film Identity by Kalhil KJ Adames (5 minutes). Listen to the song Brave sung by Sarah Barreilles. Read Brown (2017) Braving the Wilderness, Chapter 7 Strong Back. Soft Front. Wild Heart. Jot down some of your notes describing your own identity as a student. List 2-3 times in your educational experience where you have been brave by sharing your thoughts or concerns in a learning environment  whether with other learners or teachers. List 2-3 times when you wanted to speak up, but chose instead to remain silent. Reflect on how these actions impacted your experience as a learner. Consider what you might do, as a course facilitator, to encourage learners to speak up. 5.2.2 Learning Activity Read Burwell &amp; Huyser (2013). Practicing hospitality in the classroom (available through the TWU Library). In your Reflective Learning Journal, make a note of the stances described by the authors. For each Stance, list one strategy you can employ to practice hospitality in your classes. Be as specific as possible. 5.2.3 Learning Activity In this activity and discussion, you will interview another student in this class to explore strategies for creating inclusive, collaborative learning communities. First, develop a minimum of five questions to guide the interview process. The questions should be developed based on your course learning to date, and should integrate the articles, Ted talks, short films, and other resources we have reviewed together. Building on your learning, develop at least five questions that you will ask another learner, in order to answer the guiding questions of this unit: What strategies invite students to engage in collaborative learning? What strategies can we use in online learning environments to support connections between students? Then, contact the student assigned to you for this assignment and schedule a time to meet, preferably in real-time, through zoom, skype, some other form of video conferencing, or by phone. After you have completed the interview, reflect on your classmates responses and your own reading. Synthesizing your learning, prepare a 250-word discussion post, identifying at least three strategies you can use to help learners develop questions with each other. Be sure to reference the other learner for her/his original ideas. 5.3 Unit 5 Summary In this unit, we have considered how we can create learning environments where students belong, the essential nature of creating connections between learnings, and specific strategies we can use to support collaborative learning. 5.4 Assessment 5.4.1 Unit 5 Discussion After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a discussion post on the following: Part 1: Principles of Appreciative Inquiry Select two of the Principles of Appreciative Inquiry. In a 250-word post, describe a learning activity you would conduct with your class that integrates both of these principles. For example, how would you design a writing assignment that included Positive Principle? Or, describe an assignment through which you ask students to create a short video that incorporates the Poetic Principle. Part 2: Peer Interview First, develop a minimum of five questions to guide the interview process. The questions should be developed based on your course learning to date, and should integrate the articles, Ted talks, short films, and other resources we have reviewed together. Building on your learning, develop at least five questions that you will ask another learner, in order to answer the guiding questions of this unit: What strategies invite students to engage in collaborative learning? What strategies can we use in online learning environments to support connections between students? Then, contact the student assigned to you for this assignment and schedule a time to meet, preferably in real-time, through zoom, skype, some other form of video conferencing, or by phone. After you have completed the interview, prepare a 250-word blog post, identifying at least three strategies you can use to engage students in collaborative learning as well as strategies you can use to support connections between students in online learning environments. Be sure to reference the other learner for her/his original ideas. 5.5 Checking your Learning Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit.
